    "text_content": "Yesterday was another long double shift serving at a local restaurant. We get quite a few tourists this time of year but our average customer is pushing probably 60 years old if not even more elderly. It's unfortunately not terribly uncommon to come across poor tippers, you get used to shrugging off the low percentage tips and moving on to the next table. \n\nMy last table of the night (why is it always the last table?), an elderly gentleman and his wife, was fairly quick to order and eat, taking a container for more than half their meals. They shrug off my offer of boxing up any dessert and ask for the bill. I bring their check over which comes to $51 and change. He quickly whips out a wad of cash, hands me $60, and asks for his change in ones. Oh lovely.\n\nI return with his eight crisp dollar bills which he takes and slowly starts placing them at the end of the table one by one. After counting to five he looks up and it comes out... \"there, is that a good tip?\"\n\nWithout even thinking I blurt out, \"no, that's about 10%.. a good tip is fifteen to twenty percent for good service.\" Immediately begin to feel my cheeks blushing but it's too late to take back now. He sheepishly plops the other 3 bills on top as his wife chimes in with, \"well, you asked!\"\n\nOther customers have posed the same question in the past and my typical response would be something along the lines of 'I appreciate whatever you leave for me.' After the long shift I was evidently to the point of brutal honestly and my first reaction was to tell the truth. Maybe he'll even remember and tip more appropriately in the future, but let's not get our hopes up too much.",

    "text_content": "This is the first time I’ve ever flat out not tipped in years and it’s a place that came well recommended so I would really appreciate some input as to where I stand. \n\nI went to a restaurant tonight, a big name touristy type place but late at night so it wasn’t very busy. (24 tables, 6 occupied.) \n\nWhen I arrived the hostess was talking to a friend for several minutes before she acknowledged me or anyone in the line that had begun forming behind me. (I know this because when the person she was speaking with left she said, “Sorry, that was just my friend.”) \n\n\nShe asked me if I was the ten top reservation, I said no, I was a two person walk-in. The people behind me identified themselves as the ten person reservation. \n\n\nThey pushed two tables together for the ten top but then seated my party of two at one of the tables and split the group up. I said I was happy to sit elsewhere so the group could sit all together. \n\n\nThey said, pretty aggressively, “We have a system. If you want service then you have to sit where the server put you. You’re not at your house.” I almost left then and there because I was so taken aback by that but wrote it off as stress about the big group coming in. \n\n\nI sat down and asked how many people a medium pizza would feed. My server said he didn’t know. I asked approximately how big it was. He said “medium sized.” \n\n\nWhen the food came it was cold and we hadn’t been given plates or utensils yet. We asked him to take our photo and he said he had a lot to do right now but maybe later. (He was not even close to the only one working.)\n\n\nThe final straw for me was the table next to us pointed out very politely to the server that they’d been given the wrong meal (it contained ground sausage and they’d ordered vegetarian.) Instead of going and fixing it, the server tried to gaslight them saying it *was* what they had ordered. They were visibly clearly Sikh. I am sure they did not order pork. \n\n\nI asked for my check and a box for my food. The server said he’d be right back with my check but it would be about ten minutes for a box. When the check did eventually come it was a table side credit card reader and when I needed to fish in my purse for my card, he did a lot of sighing and made faces. \n\n\nHonestly, I was still planning to leave 10%, but the final incidents with the Sikh diners being served pork and his acting like he was doing us a favor by bringing the check pushed me over the edge. \n\nMaybe I am just venting at this point but I really want to know if I’m missing something. As industry professionals do you see something I did to cause this or a circumstance I might’ve been blind to that caused this? \n\nI feel terribly about the whole thing and could really use some insight. Thank you!!\n\n\nEdit — Sorry I can’t reply to every comment, this got more traction than I was expecting! Thank you for your insight and fun stories. I really appreciate it.",

    "text_content": "I work at a local BBQ joint and we don't do reservations. We have large groups come in all the time and as long as they're okay waiting for tables to clear up then there is usually never an issue. Our sections usually hold up to 30-36 people depending on which one you get.\n\nWell we had a 46 top come in around 3 o'clock one day and they were a softball team with parents and coaches. Since they were such a large group they would have to be in two different sections and have two different servers. So our hostess relayed all of that information to the head of the party and requested that they sit with who will be together on the checks. He just replies \"We just do jersey numbers for checks.\" And then just walked away to sit at the bar and drink water while he waited, which he was told would be close to an hour since we had just filled up for our midday rush. \n\nOur poor 15 year old hostess didn't know what to do so she came to us and told the servers that she didn't think they were going to sit at the same tables. I, luckily, was not gonna be a server for the group and volunteered to go explain the situation better and let them know where they'd be sitting. So I go out to where they're waiting and break it down for them a little better. I even tell them that they're okay sitting at different tables as long as they stay in the same server section. Apparently even that was too much to ask.\n\n\"That just doesn't make sense to us. Why can't we do jersey numbers?\"\n\n\"You can absolutely do numbers, but one server will have 35 of you and then the other 11 will be in a different servers section. So if you have singles or smaller groups they could fit in the 11 and the team can be in the bigger section. That's also the section with the bigger tables so it'd work out perfectly.\"\n\n\"Our kids like to sit together though. And the adults like to sit together too. So we can't do that?\"\n\n\"You're free to spread out however you'd like to in the given sections. It's just gonna get confusing on the servers and if they have people in a different sections than their own. Plus it makes it easier and faster for the kitchen.\" \n\n\"Well this is how we've done it at other restaurants and it always works out. I just don't see why we can't do it how we always do when we go out. It'll be hard for us to figure out where to sit.\"\n\nAt this point, I realized I was just wasting breath. The rest of the group was listening in but I was only really talking to the guy who gave his info for the wait. I really didn't know what else to say without being stern with them so I just told them that this is what would work best for our restaurant and that if they could do as requested by the servers taking care of them that it'd be smooth sailing. Told them I'd check on their wait time and headed back inside. \n\nI go and hunt down the two servers and explain the conversation and told them that I didn't think they'd listen about sitting even in the same sections and to prepare themselves. I don't think either of them were ready for the shitshow that preceded.\n\nIt was an absolute nightmare. Not only did they ignore the sections request but they had somehow grew in size and were now a group of 52. Our hostess had set out menus for the 46 at all the tables for them and yet they spread out in the other servers entire section as well. She at least guided most of them to the correct tables and got menus for the additional six. That was just the easy part. \n\nTheir group was taking up 9-10 tables at this point and the servers are figuring out who's on what check. Like I said they ignored even the request to sit in one section so they were all spread out. One check had 6 people all at different tables and in separate sections. I felt so bad for the servers watching them scramble around between all the tables. And one of our servers, the one with the bigger section, is on her first summer serving so she's still a little green. \n\nI was cut and was finishing my side work when they started getting their food. It apparently took another hour and a half for everyone to get their food out. And one server was ringing in food for over 20 minutes because of the way the checks were split.They were complaining that other tables were getting food before they all got their food. Server had to explain that orders from those other tables were still being rung in between their food orders as well. They didn't like that answer and demanded that their food come out next. Our kitchen does their tickets in order so not much we can do if your food isn't up next and not even made yet.\n\nIt was all around terrible for the servers and expos who brought out the food. And I'm guessing they didn't have a good time either because not one person tipped 20 percent and 5 of the checks didn't tip at all. And of course we don't do auto gratuity so one server owed money after tip outs for their checks. \n\nOverall just don't understand why people can't sit with who they're paying for. Especially with a group that size. I understand wanting to socialize but they didn't even try to make it easy. I'm from a fairly large family and whenever we go out it's usually always separate checks. Only a couple times will we be at seperate tables and at that point somebody just orders for who they have on their check to make it easy. \n\nSorry for the long post. Curious to see if others have the same problem. It's seems(to me, at least) like it's always softball/baseball teams that are the ones that have more of an issue with this and it's not too hard if they're only split between two or three tables but when it's a whole section it just gets messy.\n\nTL:DR  46 top comes into restaurant. Refuses to sit with checks after being asked, even within the same servers section. Becomes a 52 top. Upset that food came out at different times and tipped poorly.",

Anyway, I just wanted to post this because this waitress really made my day. \n\nSo, I get up around seven o'clock in the morning. Go, do my writing for the day. Try to sleep in a bit. Go into work. I have a long, hard day of work. Since it's the beginning of the month it's very, VERY busy. People were generally....okay. But afterwards I felt hungover and tired. I had promised my boyfriend we would go out later tonight since he and I had been stuck in the house all week. \n\nSo we go out to TGI Fridays. Now, the one in particular near me used to have really nasty waitresses. I mean, the meanest people around. I had work their previously for three weeks a couple of years ago myself. One of the waitresses was very nasty to me (for no reason what so ever) and afterwards I got fired for not being able to keep up. I handled it professionally, but anyway on with the story. \n\nSo once we get there I'm pretty tired. Me and my boyfriend start talking. We decide to only order the endless Apps, but see here's the catch. You can only have the endless apps of one appetizer. Yep. You heard me right. So you can have endless wings, potato skins, etc. \n\nWe ordered that and my boyfriend ordered a burger. As we were eating this waitress comes up I've never seen before. The entire time we're there she explained fully to us the best food available there. Helped out make our decisions on what to get (I was pretty out of it from work so I know I was probably like a zombie) but the entire time this woman has the biggest smile on her face. It was so genuine I even found myself smiling back at her. \n\nSo, towards the end of the night she offered to box us some of the wings I had ordered. My boyfriend mentioned she may have tricked us and charged us extra for it. Since in the endless apps you CANNOT take any of it home with you. House rules. I was going to say something, but I was to tired to care. I told him not worry about it since I was the one paying. (It was my turn to treat and I was pretty adamant with my boyfriend we needed to start taking turns paying for stuff.)\n\nSo she comes back with a box. The hot wings were served to us by another waitress, and at first we were confused. Then she says the coolest thing I've ever heard.\n\n\"Sorry, I have to trick the system. Do you mind if I use your celery as a spoon to get these in here?\" She pointed at the hot wings we had just been brought and the box. I was stunned, then smiled and said sure. \n\nSo she gave us a whole plate of hot wings. Along with dumping our Parmesan wings into the same box. On TOP of that she also made sure we had plenty of ranch to take home with us in a little container. Then just as I ask for the bills she says this,\n\n\"Do you want a soda to go too?\" I was stunned. I really wasn't used to this kind of service. We hadn't even ordered that much. Our bill came around to roughly $30, and while we technically should have been charged more she deducted the \"extra\" wings we were taking out. \n\nThis entire time while waiting on us she also continued to check up on us. Constantly made sure my drink was full, and just very kind all around to me and my boyfriend. After having a hard day at work I was very happy. I even told her about having previously worked there and how she was the nicest waitress I'd ever met. The entire time she also kept saying how much she loved her job and explaining things to people. \n\nI wanted to leave her a decent tip, so I gave $6 for the tip. I wish I could have given her more, but at that point I was down to $50 and I have a few other things I have to pay for tomorrow when I get the paycheck from my retail job. \n\nStill, she really made my day. Woke up crummy, went to work crummy, came home crummy, go out, and come back happy. Even my boyfriend was pretty happy and if it wasn't for her I don't think we would have had such a good time going out. \n\nI have a lot of respect for anyone who has to work as a server, waiter, or waitress. Even though I only did the job myself for three weeks I know how hard it can be. So kudos to awesome people like you and also to super nice retail workers! Keep up the good work, and I hope one day I'm in a position to tip bigger!\n\nP.S. Was $6 enough of a tip? I felt like I didn't tip her enough, but I really couldn't spare anymore money. ;-;",

At the old location, they were well know for not tipping. One night, I was the lucky server who’s section they were in. I did everything with a smile, fixed all their orders they never customized in the first place, refills, sauces, choosing new drinks half way through, this that, kids, the mess. Split their bills. Got a $0 tip for almost 2 hours worth of work and cleanup.\n\nWell, they now frequent this second location too. They have the same notorious no tipping agenda with full force run down the waitress for fun mentality. I looked at them get seating in my section, on a super busy night, and made a choice I am proud of to this day, I decided I wasn’t going to let them get under my skin. Not even close. You will have what you pay for, which was also every cent I could charge for every sauce and soda brand switch they requested. \n\nFirst, I gave them about 10 minutes to get seated and think about being thirsty as they watch me serve beverages to my full 6 table section. I go over once and write a beverage down for everyone and bring it out, don’t drink it too fast now bc that is all I am bringing out tonight. I go around a take everyone else’s orders, key them into the most visible computer and then proceed to take their orders last and nail every accommodation and sauce charge they ask for and walk to the furthest computer. One lady wants her food made at the end to go. I will gladly make it with the rest of the food and let it sit under the lamp until you are ready to leave. Seeing you are not tipping, I will allow the food runner to serve your meal. Oh you need extra sauce you didn’t order? Well so do 5 other tables so you can watch their sauces come first. Then I will ask what sauce it was you needed again. Oh you say refills? Give me a few moments to find that warm pitcher of tea sitting on the ledge. Hope it’s fully enough bc I am splitting between you all, not refilling it. By this time, I am being tipped out by other tables as they are asking for the checks. No tips from this family, as expected and deserved. But one lady did apologize for her sisters rudeness, and that was good enough bc the sister heard.\n\nNow, because I dearly remember you, I hope that you remember me now too. Remember that I have served you great, and remember when you didn’t pay for that service like others in my section have, you will only get exactly what you pay for. Sit somewhere else, or pay for what you want. \n\nAlso to note, I was never without a smile or kindness in my voice, I just for some reason kept forgetting about this table, like they were camouflage or something.

    "text_content": "To start off, this was a few years ago as Bar Manager at a 5 Star Hotel Bar in Sydney, Australia. We were located in the CBD area and were patronised by mostly Politicians and Lawyer types. Also I’m on mobile so please forgive the formatting. \n\nIt’s a quiet day, a group of three walks in, directly after a rush. One male, pushing 50 and two younger woman in their 20’s. \n\nWe have a sign that asks, please wait to be seated, but of course being so important he brushes past the section waiter and sits at a table laden with dishes from a High Tea we had just hosted for 8 guests. \n\nSnaps his fingers at his waiter to ‘clean this up’ and bring some menus. The waiter flags me down to help clean the table as there was a lot of things to clear of various sizes and shapes of course, not to mention the 3 tier stands which are a one per hand scenario. \n\nHis two guests kept saying thank you and asking if we wanted them to shift to a smaller table. The man interjected and said not to worry as we had mostly emptied out by this point. Although there were other small table configurations ready to go, including a booth by the window. I asked if they wanted a window table at all and the fellow goes: Why, so we can fucking look at the street we work on all day? I said of course sir, we won’t be a moment making the table ready. I got the vibe the ladies were a bit uncomfortable at this point. \n\nWhile we are sorting this out, he starts asking me about the wine selection. After asking a few questions regarding his preferences, I ran down a few suitable options for him. At this point he looks over at his lovely guests and says “oh what a surprise, he knows his wine”. After dealing with assholes like this all my life, I’m pretty much Teflon. So I made a joke and said “only cause I drink so much wine” to cut the tension and allow his to save some face. \n\nThe wine comes out, he makes a big show of the tasting, using the limited vocabulary he knows to impress his guests. They then order entrees (him - French onion soup and the ladies- seared tuna Niçoise salads and a main each. When I’m doing the quality checks on the entrees he decides to complain on behalf of his guests.  The seared tuna on the Niçoise salad looks raw in the middle. I tried to explain to him the preparation method but he said it should be cooked through. I offered the ladies to try something else but they both declined. Saying they were enjoying the salads. \n\nHe mentioned he was just giving feedback and was going to pay for it anyway as he didn’t need anything for free. But just mention it to the Chefs for next time. I of course said I would pass it on and we would take them off the check as I eye rolled my way all the way back to the kitchen. Ya know, to pretend I was going to tell our Chefs how to sear tuna. \n\nNow, for my pettiness. He flags me down to finalise the check. I drop off his bill containing two bottles of Kiwi Sauv Blanc(fairly cheap in Australia) , One entree and three mains. The bill is maybe $200AUD. \n\nI pick up a mobile eftpos terminal and go over to the table to collect the check. I can see he has specifically written $0.00 In the tip column. \n\nHe brings out the corporate card, company name, his name etc. Now if ever a card declines the terminals give us an error code such as wrong account, wrong pin, insufficient funds etc. if it’s ever the later, I try to make sure I say it, without saying it. Such as “do you want to try another card for instance. Cause otherwise it’s awkward as hell. \n\nHe was chatting up the ladies when I loudly said, IM SORRY SIR, YOUR CARD HAS INSUFFICIENT FUNDS”. This stopped the converstion and he fumbled around and said oh “some name in accounts hasn’t paid my Bill for the month. I’ll get that sorted. Just take my personal card”. By this point his tone had changed and he was being a bit softer with me. \n\nI swipe his personal card, Thank you Server Gods for this delicious moment... I interrupt him again, a little quieter this time. I’m sorry sir, this card has insufficient funds also. \n\nAt this point, both of the ladies offered to pay the bill over his protests. Even negotiating paying half each. He would have none of it. He made us all wait, while he jumped onto his banking app, to transfer the required amount to his personal card. The ladies were giving each other looks. The ladies took that time to thank us for the service and the meal. The man looked absolutely defeated by this point. Through some misplaced shame he decided to shake my hand as they left to say thank you. Like being nice all of a sudden would make everyone else forget he was a jerk. \n\nIt was small. It was petty. But it felt like victory to me.",

Working lunches there were very hectic sometimes because I was the only server most of the times and there wasn’t a food runner/busser/hostess or bartender. The restaurant was in a good location and it was a very big restaurant. Sometimes it would get so busy, I’d literally have to run to go run food or run to go make drinks. Sometimes I’d be taking care of close to 20 tables all at the same time. Anyways, we had this one older lady who was a regular. She said she had some immune system problem and demanded a bowl of hot water to clean her silverware the moment she sat down. She claimed she had diabetes and would hound me to get her food as soon as possible no matter how many food tickets were ahead of hers or how busy I was. She would never leave anything more than 20% despite being so needy and demanding. She was one of my least favorite customers of all time. Most people were very nice to me and even impressed seeing how I handled that many tables with no help. A lot of times it led to good tips or people being very patient. She would come eat at the restaurant very soon after Covid with her mask and I’m thinking why are you out here eating at a busy restaurant if you’re this old, immune system problems, diabetes and you’re scared of Covid? It honestly felt like she just wanted to give me problems, I wonder if she would do that to other servers at different restaurants or just mine because we accommodated her insane needs. Just wanted to share this story about one of least favorite customers of all time. ",

    "text_content": "I was a newbie. I had hosted for 2 years at this point but I finally got a job as a server at a semi-corporate place. I was so very excited. I loved serving and even the busiest of nights never bothered me. Attention to detail is important to me, and instantly the GM liked me because of how well I did as a rookie. She was notorious for being crazy and strict and no one liked her. But, she liked me. \n\nUp until this night I had absolutely no issues ever. It had only been a couple of weeks but I never had a complaint and any problems that occurred were fixable and from what I could tell all my customers were happy when they left. I even got a few regulars tell me I was the best service they got there. Which really meant the world to me. As time went on I started getting really good shifts. And, I was making good money. I loved the job, and the customers. \n\nUntil one lady came in. She was with her parents and two of her children. The parents were extremely nice, and I love kid so I had no issue buddying up with them. She was off from the bringing though. She was maybe in her 30s. She did not look up to me when she ordered her drink. She told her mother to shut up when she was trying to ask me about a deal we had. When I started explaining the deal anyway she snapped again “you can see the deal on the menu, I don’t know what your asking her!” I did not want to upset her anymore, so I point to where it said the deal and the mother nodded. \n\nI bring back the drinks and admittedly I did make a small mistake. She has originally ordered a lemonade but before I walked away she changed her mind to a water. I nodded, but the interaction previously kinda threw me off and I brought her the lemonade by mistake. She was the last drink I put down and Instantly when I reach down to give it to her I realize the mistake. I go to pick it up and apologize but before I can she huffs in disgust “I told you I wanted a water not a lemonade!” She yelled aggressively. I nervously laughed it off and blamed myself, I told her I must have been in autopilot and I would fix this right away. She asks if she will be charged for the lemonade, I have not rung in drinks yet so I assure her that no she will not. \n\nAll else is calm and I’m taking care of other tables before their food comes out. Her and her mother ordered burgers. I hand out all the plates and they all begin eating. After a couple minutes I check back and ask how everything is. The daughter is completely silent. The mother looks kind of worried and hesitantly says her burger is over cooked, she wanted medium but it was well done. I profusely apologize and take a look, it was a little more on the brown side. I tell her I will have her another made and I will get my manager. Then the daughter pipes up and says hers is wrong also. I repeat my apologies and tell them the manager will fix the problem (aka take the burgers off the order) while I get them new burgers. The mother insisted I don’t do that, she would just eat her burger there was no issue. To my surprise the daughter says nothing. I ask again is she sure she does not want a new burger, she once again repeats that no neither of them do. \n\nI still go to my manager and explain the situation. She comps the meals and gives them a free desert. I happily tell them this news and the mother seems really thankful. Still, nothing from the daughter. \n\nThe mother tips me 20% and all else seems well. The daughter did not look at me for the rest of the meal, but she also didn’t snap or yell at me. She did yell at her children a few times for minor things, rather loudly and aggressively. But, she seemed calmer. \n\nThe next day I come onto work I get called into the back by a manager and my GM. They ask me if I know what it’s about. I confusingly say no, I don’t. They stare at me sternly, not believing me. I ask them what happened, and if I did something wrong. I had never seen my GM mad at me about anything before. \n\n“Explain what happened last night with that table with the burgers” she tells me. It took me a couple seconds to remember what she meant. It hadn’t been something that stood out to me because it was a rather minuscule situation. But, I tell her what happened about the burgers being overcooked and me getting a manager to comp them. She then pulls out a paper with a really long paragraph. She hands it to me and tells me to read it out loud. \n\nBasically it was the biggest character assassination I ever knew possible. It was all written by the daughter. She said I was rude, called me a bitch, and said I acted like they were a nuisance and a waste of my time. I talked down on her when I said “excuse me honey” when she spoke. The only time I had said that was to her son when I reached over to hand her her water after the lemonade situation. Not to her, and not condescending. She told them her burger was burnt and she couldn’t eat it. Dispute her finishing it. She told them I rolled my eyes when she complained. And I took 30 minutes to give them a check, which was also not true. All I had to do was get the manager to comp the meals, and her mother was given the check before their meal was completely finished and desert was brought out. She also said I charged her for a lemonade she never ordered. I know I didn’t, but even if I had why wouldn’t she have said something then?\n\nApparently my GM had called her the next morning and they were on the phone for an hour. And, my GM couldn’t even get a word in because the lady was so angered she was screaming the whole conversation. By this time I was crying, I hate to admit that but I had no defense. I had no proof none of this was true. And, despite all my good reviews they believed her. Maybe not fully, but they said there was no one someone was that mad if I had done nothing wrong. They made me read a paper on their policy of treating customers. They told me I am not allowed to call anyone honey. And, what hurt the most was, they told me they might have overestimated my abilities on handling myself. And, that I would be put back in the smallest 3 table section. \n\nUltimately my hours dropped. And, the GM no longer liked me. No matter how good I did after that my reputation never recovered. I was forced to find another job. Without them as a reference I had no documentable serving experience, so I had to work my way up and a different place now. I make significantly less money, even a year later, than I would have there. All because she complained and got another free meal. She practically ruined my life over burgers. \n\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for the support!!! It’s so encouraging read kind comments and it feels like at least reddit has my back on this situation... lol. I no longer work at this place. And I have never had a situation this bad ever happen to me since. I genuinely love serving and I really do not get overwhelmed or angry about much. This place has other locations that have shut down at a high rate over the last couple years, and that should have been a warning sign before I began working at this location.\n\nEDIT 2: also I kinda realize that I think this was a little bit more of an elaborate scam than I thought at the time. The fact she didn’t speak up in front of her parents makes me believe she wanted to cause a scene after the fact. The mother was pretty insistent that she did not want to get free food and I was actually the one who asked the manager to comp it, the mother never asked me to do that. Makes me think that since the daughter remained quite up until they left means she wanted to take more advantage of the situation behind everyone else’s back. ",

About what to expect from one of these tables.\n\nSo, my question is what do you do in this situation? They are gone, so asking them anything is impossible. The total they had written was 101, so presumably that's what they expected to spend.\n\nEdit: First two comments and it's already contradictory. Very interesting that there isn't a set way to handle this.\n\nEdit 2: Felt like saying I did take the total in this scenario. Honestly I think they meant to leave me 15, if they hadn't left I would have asked, but they intended to pay 101 so that's what they were charged. Can't complain about an extra 10 bucks!",

No. But after everything I did in MY power to make sure the wait wasn’t unpleasant, I don’t think it was fair to be treated that way.\n\nHe did not tip, not a dime was left on the table, and I cried for a solid five minutes, because I owed the kitchen $20 at that point.\n\nDo you have an experience like this?

A long stream of Suburbans would drop the kids off and for a couple of hours we would be wall-to-wall teenagers. To their credit, the parents of these kids did a good job raising and they typically tipped us well. But even though they were relatively well-behaved they were still teenagers and were prone to showing off.\n\nOn one of those nights I got a three-top of guys who I would guess were sophomores. As I was finishing up at another table I overheard them bragging to each other, \"Well last time I was here I had eleven Dr. Peppers!\" \"Oh yeah? I had twelve!\"\n\nSo rather than doing my usual greet I went to the back and pulled three water pitchers and filled them with Dr. Pepper and just a little ice. The MoD saw me and said, \"We're not supposed to do that.\" I told her what I had overheard and she smiled and said, \"I don't see anything.\"\n\nI greeted the guys, put down three straws in front of them and said \"Dr. Pepper for you! Dr. Pepper for you! Dr. Pepper for you!\"\n\nThey looked up at me with awe and said something to the effect of, \"dude, your the best waiter we've ever had!\"\n\nI took their order and put it into the pos. When I came by their table they were pounding those pitchers hard. By the time their food arrived they were ready for refills. So I got three more pitchers of Dr. Pepper and brought them to the table. They didn't seem as excited this time.\n\nAfter a bit I asked them how things were and they said everything was great. I pointed out that they still had a lot of Dr. Pepper left. They said something like, \"Kinda getting full.\" I asked them, \"Didn't you have twelve last time you were here?\" To which I put on my best imitation of a coach and said, \"IF YOU WANT VICTORY YOU HAVE TO **REALLY WANT IT!**\" I was surprised how well they responded to that ploy as they started chugging those pitchers again.\n\nWhen I got back to the table they asked for their tickets as their ride was there for them. They tipped me 25%. I have to admit, I kinda felt guilty as I watched them stagger out the door all looking like they were going to hurl.",

Later after they had finished paying the grandmother came up to me and thanked me for the corny jokes with the family and the excellent service and handed me some money that was folded up. I thanked her and said that she was too kind for anything left over. Well whenever I got back the serving station at my place I reach into my pocket and found that her and her family had gave me 200 dollars extra. I quickly ran out back out on to the floor and tried to thank them again, however by this time they were long gone. \n\nI then did what almost every server I know would do, I went to my local watering hole and tipped my bartender over the bill cost. \n\nHappy holiday y’all.

Friday and Saturday nights I work the lounge blahblahblah.\n\nHad a seizure about a week ago and lost my grandmother thursday. They planned the funeral today, and to say the least I was not on my game tonight.\n\nLuckily- in the lounge there is a looser feel because everyone is drunk and it is packed shoulder to shoulder with people listening to the loud-as-fuck band. \n\nI am on my last table after closing the kitchen 30 minutes before that. The band is still playing and there are still plenty of people drinking at the bar. I decide to join the rest of the crew outside for a post-shift cigarette.\n\nI go check on my last two top, a mother and daughter, the mother is pretty drunk; but they smile at me and give me the okay symbol. \n\nI join my friends outside, we smoke a cigarette; and I admittedly take my time because the vibe my table gave was that they were trying to enjoy their drinks while listening to the band.  I go back in to check on them-\n\n\"We ready for another round ladies?\" I yell over the band.\n\nThe mom looks pissed \"I asked you for the check\" She says in an indignant drunk voice, the daughter is looking surprised that she said that. \n\nI scruntch my face at the answer \"umm, I dont think you did; but Ill go grab it right quick. Sorry bout that\" I finish with a smile\n\n\"Yes I did, I did this-\" she draws a check mark in the air with her finger. \"When people do that it means we were ready for the check.\"\n\n\"Okay, let me get it right quick.\" I keep my shit eating smile on and very quickly grab the check. I return and the card is sitting on the table, I drop the check on the table and grab the card \"Lemme go run this right quick.\" \n\n\"Wait wait wait.\" She grabs my arm and spends almost a full fucking minute looking over the 34$ check. \"Okay go ahead.\" I force a smile and walk off\n\nI am so fucking over it at this point but hold my tongue.\n\nI drop the sign receipts back at the table. \"Y'all have a great night.\" \n\nThe daughter dawns a big smile \"Thanks so much\"  trying to recover this interaction after her mothers obvious shitty attitude. \n\nI walk off- start entering in my tips for the night at the near by POS.\n\nGo back to the table after they left and grab their signed receipt. \n\n-$0- tip and in giant letters at the top\n\"LAZY ASSHOLE, FIRE HIM\" \n\nOh hell to the fuck no.\n\nI grab the receipt and go outside to find them right outside the front door.\n\n\"Excuse me mam.\" I tap her shoulder; she drunkenly turns with low eyes.\n\n\"This shit right here?\" I crumple the receipt in her face \"This shit doesn't fly around here. I wanted to say, sorry I was a little distracted tonight. But I literally just lost my grandmother.\"\n\n\"So take this back\" I throw the reciept ball into her face, it bounces off her forehead \"and get out of here, you arent welcome back.\"\n\nShe bends down and grabs the receipt ball \"Oh you'll hear about this.\"\n\n\"I AM A FUCKING HUMAN LADY, NOT JUST SOME MACHINE THAT BRINGS YOU FUCKING FOOD.\" I shout  back at her. Everyone outside is looking at this point. I turn around and storm back inside to my manager and tell him I snapped on a customer. \n\nThe biggest thing I cant get over.

She said she just didn't want it too tomato-y or onion-y and that the pico was fine. I said okay and put it in. She kept making jokes about how she is picky and this is typical of her and she's so quirky. \n\nThey proceed to run me around (napkins, a new drink, want to change drink, second person now wants to change drink, salt and pepper before food arrives ect.) And then when I finally get them settled their food comes out. They ask me for a pad of butter, salsa, salt and pepper (yes again, they told me they were done) and some pancake syrup.

I said I was already going to get it but I was just trying to help her get something to drink. She gives me her drink order with an attitude.\n\nThey then have a FIFTH friend. They asked to put tables together and we said no (sections) but offered a 5 top instead. When the woman gets there they try to pull a chair up even though we already told them they'd have to move. They begrudgingly move and leave their old table in a mess which I go to clean right as the fifth person sits down. As soon as she sits her friend calls me and says she's ready to order. With dishes clearly in my hand I tell her to give me a minute. I come back, ask her what she wants to drink and she said: \"No I'm ready to order.\" I said \"well I need to ring in your drink too so will you tell me what you want to drink and then what to want to eat?\" She gives in. I go to check on her after she gets her food and say: \"Did you get everything? Does it all look right?\" She gestures to the food and rolls her eyes.\n\nThis entire time they are joking about how they are difficult and picky especially the omelet lady. When it was time to pay the fifth lady paid for everyone and left a 3.00~ tip on 97.00~\n\nWorst part is they caught my manager and asked was I new because they felt like they had to ask for everything. I wanted to scream. The only reason why you had to ask was a. You kept changing your drink and adding people. And b. Because you NEVER LET ME GET A CHANCE TO GRAB IT.\n\nIt's NOT cute to go out and be difficult or purposefully picky.

We don’t have a hostess, food runners, or bussers, so when we’re busy, I try to get things done as fast as I can.\nTonight during a pop I had these two guys (dad and son) that both went to the bathroom at the same time. I had just put their order in and then started cleaning tables. I wasn’t even thinking about it and bussed their drinks and wiped their table. It was really embarrassing. The dad was clearly upset when they came back. They tipped me 10%, but it was understandable. Thankfully, most of my other people were pretty generous tonight. TGIF on a Monday!",

I was walking away from taking two table's orders, after which I was planning on grabbing waters and greeting a new table that had sat down maybe 3 minutes before.Since our restaurant is pretty small, when it gets busy it gets super loud, plus we have a full bar so the customers drinking get pretty loud as well. \n\nAs I'm walking back to input the orders, the father from my new table flags me down as I walk past him and asks who their waiter is. It's a party of three, a mom, dad, and daughter who looked about 16. I look at their table and see he has his phone timer on facing me, thankfully the timer was at 2 minutes, but I could tell they were going to be a fun party. \n\nFather: F\n\nMother: M\n\nMe: I'm actually your server tonight, would you like me to take your order now? \n\nF: Yes, I would like a small cheese pizza\n\nMe: Great, would you like thin crust or deep dish?\n\nF: Thin crust\n\nMe: Okay, and for you? (to the mother)\n\nM: I want gluten free and vegan\n\nMe: Okay, we have a gluten free crust that's the same size as the small thin crust and a vegan cheese option, would you like any toppings on that?\n\nM: What comes on it?\n\nMe: Well you can choose any of our specialty pizzas or you can build your own with any of the toppings on this list (pointing to the list on the menu).\n\nM: But what already comes on it?\n\nMe: So far I just have vegan cheese on it, would you like just cheese on the pizza?\n\nM: Well I don't know, what toppings come on the vegan cheese? \n\nMe: The vegan cheese is just the replacement we use if you want vegan cheese, it doesn't include any toppings. You can choose any of these toppings or one of our specialty pizzas.\n\nM: Oh, so I choose toppings that you add to the pizza?\n\nMe: Yes! (I still have two tables' orders to put in and this conversation has been going on for at least five minutes)\n\nM: okay, what vegetables are vegan?\n\nI'm not even joking, she didn't say what TOPPINGS are vegan, she said VEGETABLES!! I had just gotten back from a table that thought it was funny to mess with me all night (the salad was too small HAHA just kidding, acting offended when I asked if they wanted anything else tonight before handing them the check, etc) so I just stood there and smiled at this lady.\n\nF: Did you just hear yourself? You asked what vegetables are vegan, that doesn't make sense. She's asking what toppings you want!\n\nM: Oh hahaha okay. I will get pepperoni. \n\nI say nothing about the lack of veganness in pepperoni, I am tired and I am not going to repeat this whole thing. \n\nMe: Wonderful! Anything else for you guys?\n\nF: She (the teenage daughter) will have the kids cheese pizza. Actually pepperoni. With bacon. Only bacon actually. Maybe pepperoni and bacon. Actually, no bacon, sorry daughter, maybe next time. \n\nI read back their order, starting with the thin crust the father ordered. \n\nF: Thin crust??? I wanted thick crust! I wouldn't come here for thin crust, I always get thick crust everywhere! \n\nMe: Oh I'm sorry, deep dish. (I clarify deep dish and not thick crust because those are two different crusts and I don't want this man expecting a fluffy pizza and getting a deep dish... which is not at all fluffy or has a thick crust.) That's cool that you're able to find other good deep dish pizzas, I haven't seen another pizza place in the area with deep dish. (I'm genuinely just trying to be friendly, Chicago deep dish is very uncommon in my area.\n\nHe just stares at me and looks slightly mad that I corrected him from thick crust to deep dish, and that I commented on how he only eats deep dish apparently.\n\nI finish up with them and put their order in, they leave me a 15% tip so that's good, but it was just so weird how bad they were at ordering, plus timing me to see how long it took to greet them was not cool.\n\nEdit: they ordered a salad at first and the father said he wants the cheese on the side because his wife likes the cheese, so lactose intolerant is out of the question.",

It was actually really good value for the money, but every server absolutely HATED working that shift.\n\nA normal, non-jaded person would think \"hey, just seat the people, keep their drinks filled, and pre-bus their plates and it's an easy $5-10 tip, right?  RIGHT??\"  Forehead slap.\n\nThese fricking people.  First of all, church people are the shittiest tippers.  Not every one of them, but on average?  Yeah, they suck hairy balls.  Sorry if you are a church person who tips well.  \n\nThey always seemed to start with an 8-top.  That turns into a 12-top.  That becomes a 20-top.  You get the drift.  A nebulous head count that doubles and triples in size like an amoeba on steroids.\n\nYou'd start at one end of the table and take drink orders; while dropping the drinks before you can even get to the end of the table there'd be a crotch spawn rattling their ice at you.  How the hell can a 6-year-old slurp down 20oz in 2 minutes?\n\nThe people who show up at 1:45 and when you tell them the buffet is about to be closed down, they say \"no problem, we'll be fast!\"  And then cue hissy fit when they realize that 'close down' means food is removed and goes bye-bye into the nether regions of the kitchen.\n\nSeparate fucking checks.  Ohmigod.  Mom and Dad:  \"It's the two of us plus the red head and the twins with the suspenders.\"  Meanwhile it's like musical chairs, except instead of one less chair per people, there are 6 extra chairs and people moving every 30 seconds.\n\nFinally, you know how after a tornado hits a small town and all that is left are twisted gnarled trees and concrete pads and detritus strewn all over the ground?  Picture the scene after a locust swarm 20-top with 12 kids heads out the door.  Check for $200?  Lucky if the tip is $10 - and you get to spend 20 minutes cleaning up.\n\nRant over.

    "text_content": "This happened earlier this week. I work for a small mom and pop store with table service and damn good food. We used to be open 6 days a week, but as of this week we are now open 7 days a week. Usually when we make changes to the hours, it takes a while for people to pick up on it and it's generally VERY slow to start, so the owner put me as the solo server, with one cook in the kitchen. We have 12 tables as well as a patio, and our tickets are hand written, we do not have a POS system. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we open for lunch and immediately get a 8 top. Ok no problem. I get their drinks and orders and in walks a 10 top. Okay I got this. But then, no, I don't got this, because within 20 minutes my entire store was FULL. There was literally a new ticket coming in to the kitchen every 2 minutes. Soon we go on a wait, and people begin sitting outside. I'm struggling to keep up, get all the drinks out, all the orders in, running food. As people piled in I started warning tables that all the food is cooked to order and this was the first day we were open this day, so we only had one person in front and one in back, people seem understanding. But then I have to start adding up tickets (by hand). Guess who is all separate checks? The 8 top. And also the 10 top. I'm SCREWED. Drinks are going un-refilled, one of my poor outside tables doesn't even have menus yet, food isn't getting run, there's a wait but tables aren't getting bussed. I'm deep deep deep into the jungle, not just the weeds, trying to turn an entire restaurant over at the same time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had called for another server to come in, she was scheduled at 1 and she said she'd come right away, but didn't actually show up until her scheduled start time. Overall the guests were cool because they saw that I was running my ass off and apologizing and thanking people for their understanding like mad. Nobody could have pulled this off, it was NUTS. So I get a good amount of the tables turned over, and I deliver the check to a 2 top of late fifty-year-old Karens who have the same generous apple figure and the same Karen haircut. Separate checks of course. So I go back and separate them, one card and one cash. I bring their payments back and apparently I messed up. I accidentally charged the card for the cash total and vice versa. It happens, it's easy to fix. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut no. Karen doesn't want me to fix it. My store owner is standing by the card machine, I point him out and again reiterate how easily we can fix it. No. She tells me that when I ran their food, I also gave her the other Karen's food, and I gave the other Karen her food. Whoops, that happens sometimes, I am usually pretty good at remembering who had what. But when I'm solo on a packed store/patio and a wait that all came in at the same damn time, I couldn't even tell you what your whole table ordered. I was flying by the seat of my pants lady. She said it showed that I wasn't paying attention. I start to protest and explain how it was our first day open this day and we thought it'd be slow and I was doing my absolute best to keep up, but nobody would have been able to do it better. Karen informs me that I don't need to explain myself to her. She's run plenty of restaurants, and I simply wasn't.paying.attention. Ok Karen. I apologize again and again, offer again to fix the charge. Nope. She sensed weakness and had the chance to be kind. But she had to tear down the last little shred of whatever it was that was holding me together at that point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a strong sense of justice and despite my best efforts, I freaking cry when I feel like I've been wronged. I felt tears welling up as I justified myself to her but held them back. The restaurant had emptied out, and my coworker had shown up. My store owner told me I had just done the impossible by running the entire front of house through that shit. But I looked at the mess of tickets, card receipts, and cash at my station and I just lost it. Burst into tears and couldn't stop crying for like 15 minutes, and I'm cry-laughing, my coworkers are shocked/concerned because I didn't want to be crying and I was just overwhelmed by the rush and hurt by a bitchy Karen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny other day I could have laughed off the criticism, knowing I really do try my very best and the store owner knows that. I'm damn good at this job and I actually care. But that day, that Karen saw my weakness. She could have responded with empathy but chose to cut me down and it worked. I'm just glad that she didn't see me cry. And I call bullshit on her having managed restaurants, or she'd have been able to see how hard I was trying and that I was flying solo in a really busy store. Oh, and Karen and Karen tipped me a dollar each on a $30 ticket. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Stressed solo server on a completely full store, Karen senses weakness and destroys server instead of being kind.

    "text_content": "Going to be a decently long post but I really feel compelled to share. For context, I'm a 21-year-old college student. Born and raised in the deep midwest (basically Canada), but I currently go to school in the South, and I serve 2-3 days a week down here.\n\nI've been struggling with mental health issues my entire life, and these past few weeks have really kicked my ass. One thing about depression is the constant feeling of being a burden, of not having value, and just kind of being there floating through life. In the past few weeks, those feelings have been as bad as ever, to the point where a part of me genuinely believes that I'm not really worth anything. The worthlessness obviously isn't true, but it's all too real in my head. I've been scraping by recently, and it's certainly impacted me at work. Anxiety and depression is a parasite, taking any small hold it can on your brain, and latching on harder and tighter, growing by the day until you give in and let it fester. I've had these episodes before, and I've always been able to push through them eventually, but it doesn't make it any less brutal to experience.\n\nBecause of this, I've been a shell of my usual personality at work recently. I'm a veteran there, one of the longest tenured servers on staff, and usually an emotional leader so it's been pretty obvious that something's up. It was to the point that last night my manager was concerned that I was pissed at him. I wasn't. I was just pissed. On the close last night, we were super busy until about two hours before close, but by 9:30 or so we were pretty much finished with closing work and just sitting around waiting for 11 pm.\n\nAt 10:40, a 7-top walked in. Six of them only spoke Spanish, with one woman in the group able to speak a bit of English. I'm a Spanish minor, so I've taken tables in Spanish before, but at this point in the night I was not in a good mindset to do anything besides mop and leave. It wasn't my turn in rotation, but I begrudgingly agreed to take the table, because honestly there was no way anyone else was going to be able to efficiently and competently give them service.\n\nI walked up to them and greeted them in Spanish. As I mentioned, I'm very obviously midwestern. I look like any copy-and-paste business frat bro (not in a frat but I look exactly like every guy in the business school) and I've been told I have a pretty obvious midwestern accent. When I came up and introduced myself in Spanish, they were floored, and then they all got really excited. I told them kitchen closed in 15 minutes, and requested they try and get their orders in quickly before kitchen close. I grabbed them waters, and when I came back, most of them were ready to order. I helped translate the menu for those who weren't, and somehow managed to get all of their orders in three minutes.\n\nI'm definitely not fluent, and there were a couple of translation issues, but I could tell how thrilled they were to be able to order in their native tongue. A couple of the guys excitedly dapped me up when they ordered, and I realized how much they appreciated the fact that they were able to do so.\n\nThe food came out, all correct, and later on they were taking a selfie. I asked if they needed me to take a pic of them, and everyone once again got really excited, telling me I was the best and how much they appreciated me.\n\nThey all were separate checks- no problem. They ate quickly, and I let them know about the auto grat for a large party. I told them in both Spanish and English, because I wanted to make sure that I could communicate clearly that there was no pressure to tip on top.\n\nOn the way out, one of them told me that they had gotten together in the States for a week, and they were all flying back tomorrow. They all were from different countries- Venezuela, Colombia (I could have told you that one, I suck with Colombian accents lmao), Ecuador, basically all over South America. This was the last night they had together, and they thanked me because usually going out to a restaurant is incredibly difficult, but I had made it easy on them. It struck me how I would never see these people again, but I had managed to make a tangible difference in all of their lives. I was only their server, but I managed to help make a memory for a group of friends in what had been their first in-person meetup in years. This was the last thing they all would do together for a long time, and I was able to make a positive impact on their last night together.\n\nThey all tipped cash on top of the 20%- I made sure to let them know they didn't have to, but they told me to keep it, and that I deserved it. They left, and I finished closing, but as I was mopping I realized that that table was the first time in a long time where I had genuinely felt valuable and needed. That night out is the type of random memory that they'd go back and tell their families, how on the last day of the trip some random gringo college student was able to take their orders in their native tongue. My Spanish was by no means perfect, but damn it if it didn't get the job done.\n\nIt's so weird how life works. I didn't want that table. I was really just working to run out the clock so I could go home. And yet, by pure chance, they needed me and I needed them. As I'm writing this, I'm smiling in memory of how I was able to help them out, how nice they were, and the looks on their faces when I walked up and they realized how much easier of a task ordering would be.\n\nI'm not making this post as a celebration of myself. I just work here, man. I did what I had to do. But my table last night truly changed my perspective on my own self-worth, and how even the smallest actions and interactions can make such a big difference in someone's life. So thank you to table 41, because a random group of South Americans were able to rip off the parasite that told me I didn't matter. In half an hour, I went from believing I didn't really matter to joking and talking to a table who really, truly needed me.\n\nBut apparently, not as much as I needed them.\n\nEdit: Comments are taking me out thank you guys",

All of our drivers knew about this customer and at least twice we had to fire drivers for starting fights over who would take it. In this time I was promoted to Assistant Manager and usually only delivered during lunch or on weekends when we got really busy. I still made out pretty well on tips just from that.\n\nThe Tuesday before that year's Super Bowl, we got a call from Mrs. Awesome. They were having a party for the game and wanted us to cater. She spoke with the owner of the store (who was extremely good at his job, he almost always had our backs when customers were being unreasonable) and he cut her a special deal. The actual total on the slip was just shy of $800. At regular price it would have been nearly twice that. As this was the middle of the afternoon, he called me back to his office to discuss the order. We both knew that Sunday would be our busiest day yet and we had *everyone* scheduled to work. Given the size of the order, he realized one driver probably wouldn't be able to do it alone. All of our drivers had compact cars of some sort. He suggested having 2 or 3 drivers split up the order and split the tip. I was the exception to the rule, driving a 1989 Lincoln Town Car. I did some quick math and a brief simulation with empty boxes and realized that if I emptied the trunk, I could take the whole order in one trip. I sold him on this idea by suggesting that all of the drivers would be running around like crazy as it was, and having 3 of them out for extra time to deliver that one order would back everyone else up. \n\nSunday came, and the lunch rush was about normal for a Sunday, with a few more carryout orders than usual. The owner and I started on the pizzas at noon, putting them on a rack so they could all go in the oven as close to delivery time as possible. 3 hours later, the pizzas were ready, the wings were hot and sauced, breadsticks boxed and ready to go, and I had already packed the bottom of my trunk with the crates of 2-liter sodas before we opened that day. Four of us played Pizza Box Tetris loading my car up as quickly as possible, and I was off. I pulled up to their house just before 4, about an hour from kickoff. Guests had already arrived, but they left room for me to get close to the front door. They had a buffet line set up for the pizzas, serving trays with sterno cans for the wings and breadsticks, and a tub of ice for the sodas. I started hauling in the order, and Mrs. Awesome started shuffling things around on the buffet line to make room for more. It only took 40 minutes to get everything set up, and when the last items made it in, Mrs. Awesome handed me an envelope. \n\n\"Please make sure the kids who helped make the pizza get something out of this.\"\n\nI knew the store would be very busy by now, so I thanked her and drove off, not looking at the envelope. When I got back, the owner asked me how it went. I pulled out the envelope and looked inside to find 14 $100 bills, then told him what she said. He said to keep it but give $20 to everyone who helped slice pizzas and load the car. I walked away that night with $500 just from her delivery, and probably $100 more from the other runs I took as halftime approached.\n\nThe next morning, that money went in to the bank. Combined with my tax refund and 3 more weeks of tips, I resigned from Domino's, loaded up my Town Car with everything I could fit inside, and drove off to fulfill a dream. Four days later I was settling in to my new home in Seattle and getting ready for a whole new career line with its own interesting stories. If it hadn't been for that order, I probably would have delayed that move indefinitely.",

AYCE we do not. i’ve heard from the staff who have been there a while we used to be great and never got back to it\n\nso dear customers, don’t expect unrealistic things and get pissy when they don’t go your way. we all know this is a shit show we are not unaware. take it up with the big bosses and not the ppl working their ass off for so little. we aren’t sitting here twiddling our thumbs we are working as best we can. at this point my reward for a busy shift isn’t bigger money, it’s getting out in one piece. this AYCE is a dumbass idea because we’ve had a busier rush than this and done great and had people happy. but it calms down cause it’s one goddamn order. not a million fucking reorders and ppl being there for hours\n\nTL;DR stop being an ass and leave the struggling staff alone. we know it’s bad. don’t take it out on us",

    "text_content": "So I work at a local pub, and we’re currently experiencing some management issues that reflect our scheduling and of course result in us being understaffed. \n\nYesterday, I was working alone as I usually do on a Monday evening. I was told not to have my on call come in because they weren’t expecting it to be busy… big mistake. It’s a beautiful day out, we just had the total eclipse happen, and many family’s had the day off for the event. So, it was balls to the wall busy from the get go. Usually, I start turning groups away, especially if they do not have a reservation, because there’s only so many people I can serve even if we have enough tables to seat every single person that walks in (it’s a large restaurant).\n\nThis man walks in and asks for a table for 8. I asked if he had a reservation as I had one reservation for 5:45pm for 7 people, and he lied and took it. They sat in the spot reserved for another group that actually did call. It created such a mess, and when I confronted the group about it, they shrugged their shoulders and said that they always get in without a reservation—not even ACKNOWLEDGING that they stole the reservation from someone else. I didn’t kick them out because they had their drinks and I know my boss would be upset, but it caused such a mess in my service that was already a mess because I was stressed out and alone. \n\nThe table then proceeds to demand that I prioritize their food because they had kids who were hungry… I told them no and that they had to patiently wait like everyone else. They then demanded I do a bunch of modifications for them, such as “have them make my bacon extra crispy” and “no ice in my water”, when I had no time for them and a full restaurant to deal with. \n\nAnyways, they split the bill in two, and they each tipped me $5.00 on their respectful $85.00+ bills and proceeded to chew me out for “being rude” to them… I have never been this angry at a customer before because if anything I did them a massive favour by letting them stay seated when I could’ve kicked them out. They didn’t understand the concept of making a reservation, and nor did they understand that I was completely alone and that their demands were so menial and unnecessary. Moreover, they didn’t take ownership nor understand that taking someone else’s reservation is disrespectful and rude. I wish I could’ve punched them in the face and really gave them a proper piece of my mind, and it really reminds me of how much of a shit job serving can be lol \n\nEDIT: I think people are a bit confused, but I DID in fact ask for the name under the reservation, and the man peered into my book (which unfortunately has big writing) and noticed our one and only reservation for 7 people, thus taking their name. I didn’t seat them without asking for a name, nor give them the details right after they simply said “we have a reservation.” I did everything by the book, these are just major assholes.\nMOREOVER, the problem with them still being there after I confronted them is that it added more stress to my service. I would’ve refused them had I known they didn’t have a reservation as I didn’t have room for another group of 8 people. I had to seat the actual reservation out of honour and respect of them making one, thus I now have 15 extra people instead of the original 7, on top of everyone else that was in the restaurant who were groups of 2s, 3s and 4s.

It's been over a decade since I've worked in any type of restaurant, however some outstanding events will never leave my memory.\n\nI'll post this one first and when I have the time, I'll post others. \n\nI used to be a server at a popular seafood restaurant in the Inland Empire. There was a large Black population in the city the restaurant was in, so a large portion of our guests would be Black people. This never bothered me because, well, why the heck should it? I took care of everyone all the same who crossed my path and I've never had any issues. \n\nWell, it wasn't until I was about a month into this restaurant and working the lunch shift that I started to fully pay attention to how my fellow servers treated customers. This particular day had a lot of Black guests. There were groans coming from my co-workers, all complaining that Black people are cheap, they don't tip, blah blah blah. So I asked one server if it's that much of an issue for you, I'll be happy to take your table. They happily said yes. Soon the majority of servers all gave up their tables to me simply because the people were Black and they thought it would be a waste of time. \n\nI was really pissed and disappointed in everyone, but I didn't have too much of a backbone nor an understanding of how to begin to have a talk about race with others, so I did the next best thing. Any time a table had left, I went to check my tip then I went to the server who gave up their table to me and told them how much I was tipped. Each time it was at least 20% tip, each time they seemed shocked and a little upset they gave up the table. By the end of my shift, I made about $200, though that would be the only time I would ever make that during lunch because other servers didn't give up as many tables to me anymore. \n\nAfter the lunch rush I had come to the conclusion that maybe Black people don't suck at tipping, maybe your crappy attitude towards them affects how you serve them and you just suck. Why should they tip you? \n\nIn Arizona, Mexican people were the targets of this stereotyping. Again, I've never had an issue with any person of any race. I was tipped based on how well I served them or from what they could afford. Everyone deserves to have a night out, but that doesn't mean that they can also afford to tip generously.",

    "text_content": "I work at a resort restaurant that serves food to a neighboring poolside bar.  Every summer, when the bar opens, I'm scheduled to work as a cocktail server, taking and running orders to customers.  Yesterday was my first big day back as a server and I was excited.\n\nThis weekend, the resort was hosting a big golf tournament and a large wedding, so the pool was LOADED with people.  Imagine a sea of human heads bobbing up and down rather than water, and you can basically imagine what our crowd was like.  And these people were THIRSTY.  They wanted alcohol and, luckily for them, I was here to make their dreams come true.\n\nThe shift was absolute chaos.  People were demanding drinks every five minutes and it was difficult to keep up with, especially with the Texas heat boiling everything in sight.  Half way through, I come up to a group of gentlemen, who were part of the golf tournament (important for later).  I'm taking a few orders from them, when one of their friends, who I'll just call Jeff, cuts in and tells me that he's going to get his credit card and for me to charge all their drinks onto that card.  I say okay and as he's exiting the cool, sunscreen-tainted waters of the pool to get his card, I'm talking to his friends and finishing their orders.\n\nA minute later, I hear a loud, piercing whistle echo right above and behind me.  Then, I hear a bellowing \"HEY!\"\n\nOne by one, heads in the pool start to turn.  Their eyes show an expression or either confusion or curiosity as the source of the whistle, our deer friend Jeff, holds his credit card in the air.\n\nHe then says *\"EVERYONE GETS ONE ON ME!  ONE. DRINK!\"*\n\nThere's a millisecond of silence before the crowded pool erupts into cheers, victorious whistling, and chanting as Jeff stands there, victorious.  You know those scenes in movies where a guy says \"drinks are on me?\"  Well, to be honest, I never once thought I'd be in the middle of such a scenario.  I felt like I had stumbled into a crowded concert, not a pool.  My poor, introverted little heart was freaking out while my mind was trying to figure out what the heck was going on.  As I stand up, Jeff proudly hands me his card, which I take with a fearful and uncertain gaze I kept hidden behind my sunglasses.  I retreat to the bar, where my bewildered and unaware co-workers and customers stand questioning what happened.  I'm holding Jeff's card, asking what to do, and I'm told to basically do it.\n\nSo that's what I did.\n\nI went around the pool, taking orders as normal and keeping the card with me.  I stop by this one guy, Gary, who I recognized as one of the men in the group and ask him why Jeff did this and if it was TRULY okay.  I honestly thought maybe he was drunk and this was a decision made solely on that and was worried to charge a poor drunk man with hundreds of dollars of drinks.  Gary chuckles and said he was definitely serious and explains that it's a special occasion.\n\nRemember how I said these guys were from a golf tournament?  Well, Jeff had apparently participated and got a Hole-in-One on one of the courses.  If you've never played golf or even know anything about it, this is INSANELY lucky and rare.  The odds depend on the kind of hole you're playing on as well as many other conditions, but the average golfer basically has a 12,500/1 chance in getting one.  The stars would LITERALLy have to align for a golfer to get a Hole-In-One.  I was honestly kind of shocked to learn this and told Gary that I didn't even think it was possible outside of a mini-golf game.  He smiles, looks at me, and says \"Well, why do you think he's celebrating it?\"\n\nI understood immediately, smiled, and got to work.\n\nWhat was originally chaos became APOCALYPTIC.  I, as well as my other co-worker, were constantly flagged down for drinks, even while we were delivering others.  We had so many orders for Pina Coladas that we burned through almost four gallons of mix, as well as two bottles of rum (we added alcohol, rather than mix it in the machine).  One of our bosses actually sent out a server from the inside to help and the look on his face when he saw the crowd was honestly kind of hilarious.  We took almost an hour to take everyone's orders, make them, and deliver them.  People were actually pretty patient and found our rushing around to be entertaining.  One couple even tipped me a $100 bill in secret because I was going back and forth so often without complaining at all, which they found impressive.  They even left a 110% tip on their check as thanks for the service.  I made sure to give them the best hugs a stranger could give another stranger.\n\nIn the end, Jeff's bill was somewhere around $760, which included a 20% tip we added.  I half expected Jeff to be upset in some capacity, but he was actually an awesome guy.   He took his massive bill, looked at the total, and just said \"Huh, well I expected it to be bigger!\"  He laughed, signed, and thanked me for the service.  He even patted me on the back before he and his group left for the day.\n\nDespite how terrified I was at first, the whole experience was really fun, if I'm being honest.  It helped how many people were understanding about it and even patient with us.  We're still struggling with understaffing, despite being so far away from the pandemic, and yet, we're working our butts off to make sure service is nearly perfect for our guests.  It's hard, but when people are appreciative and reward us for our hard work, it really helps us.\n\nTo Jeff, congrats on that Hole-In-One.  You deserved it!  I hope you remember that moment for the rest of your life and never EVER forget it.  And to the rest of you, whether you work in service or not, remember to tip your servers and always keep in mind that a lot of us care about you, not just as customers, but people with needs too.

We had a family of 12, and according to our policy, we had to sit them separately and they weren’t allowed to move seats. 4 out of the 12 decided to seat at the 6 chair table cause it was a lot bigger (we allow customers to seat wherever they like just as long as they are following policy). \n\nAbout 30 minutes in, a family of 5 (the rich family) comes in. We tell them that there will be at least a 20 minute wait due to the people having the only 6 chair table and we weren’t allowed to bring tables together. \n\nThe rich family was about to leave until the people who sat at the huge table called us over and said they can move at a smaller table. The rich family thanks them and we move their food to another table and sat down the rich family. \n\nThey order their food and towards the end of their meal, they asked if they can pay for the table that gave up their seat for them. I said: \n“Oh most certainly! However they are actually a party of 12, and their bill is probably over 200 dollars. Are you alright with that?” \nHe said “psh that’s fine” \n\nHe paid for his 50 dollar bill, AND the 200+ dollar bill (plus automatic gratuity). In addition, be tipped both me and my coworker 20 bucks each on top of the gratuity. \n\nHe spent about 300 bucks that day.\n\nThe party of 12 was shocked and thanked them for their kindness. \n\nIt was a good night shift :)\n\n\nEdit: wow I didn’t know how expensive other places can be LMAO. The party of 12 was a family from what I remember, like 6 adults and 6 kids. I don’t remember the prices nor what they ordered. But I remembered the rich family only ordered 4 sushi plates. Which were 10-12 bucks around that time each. \n\nI do remember the party of 12 ordered both ramens and sushi. The ramens were 11-15 bucks at the time. And the sushi was about 8-14 bucks depending which one you got. I don’t remember if anyone got soft drinks or alcohol. But cocktails were $3.50 and beers were about 8ish bucks I believe. Appetizers were about 7-14 bucks depending what you got!",

We ran out of a lot of items like steak, rice, and fries, which can usually be replaced with an alternative. Either way we made it to the end of the day with no problem. \n\nUntil... a family of ten shows up at the door. I was exhausted from the tough day and when I saw them I wanted to evaporate into thin air. \n\nBut, they made a “valid” argument that we were technically still open and my uncle peeped his head out of the kitchen and told me to just let them in and he’ll turn the stoves on again and see what he can make them. \n\nAlso, let me be clear that I WARNED them before they sat down that we had run out of a lot of items and the husband and some of the older kids agreed they should just go somewhere else but the wife argued that they’re already here, so they sat down. \n\nAlso let me point out that she looked like she was already not in the best of moods, or had the best attitude to begin with. \n\nThey looked at their menus and I brought them their drinks and everything was going fine until it was time to take their orders. It’s like they completely forgot I warned them and they asked for the things we were missing anyway... and i had to deny them one by one all the items they were listing while the wife rolled her eyes at me each time. \n\nI offered them the alternatives and they would complain saying they preferred steak over chicken and stuff like that and she asked if they were getting a discount because we were out of stuff and usually I would’ve said yes because I have a lot of control over stuff like that, since it’s my family’s place, but this lady was so rude and I was tired and not in the mood to be fake friendly. So I told her we don’t offer discounts for things that can be replaced with alternatives. \n\nShe did not like that. \n\nThey eventually got their food and let me note that it’s almost an hour after closing now and they still haven’t left. Even after they’ve finished eating they sat and talk for another 15 minutes. \n\nI am tired, annoyed, and I have school the next day. \n\nThey come to the register after they’re finally done chatting and my cousin at the register charges them for their food and then they start pestering her over a discount and how we should’ve gone to the deli or a store to get them what they wanted because “the customer is always right” \n\nMy uncle was nice enough to even let them in after we had already turned everything off to start cleaning. \n\nAlso they left no tip and announced they’ll  never come back again and were gonna tell their friends to never come here again either. \n\nAlso guess who came back only a few months later.

I’ve served folks that carried themselves in similar fashions who didn’t, but, I’m open to being surprised! \n\nOne of the guys is celebrating his birthday! They’re chatty and kind of fun so I think okay, I can snag a coupon from the front desk and let him have a mixed drink on the house for his special night. His girlfriend orders a holy water and we joke about being basic bitches, we’re having a good time so far! \n\nThey order a few shots and more mixed drinks and beer, eventually the bill is just shy of $110. The third fella, who seems to be third-wheeling it for his buddy’s birthday, asks what the bill is and brings out his wallet. Puts $120 in cash down, I grab him his change, and his pals get up and leave. One fella at the bar asks, “Did they leave you anything?” \nI still have a smile on my face. “No, and I could’ve made a lot of money had I bet on it too.”\n\nHalf a hour later they come back down for a smoke and birthday boy orders some drinks for the room. We get talking while I’m whipping them up and turns out he’s from my neck of the woods on the other side of the country! We reminisce about the mountains and the mild winters, smiles all around. He pays for his bill in cash, takes the change I got him and puts it in his pocket and once again walks away. I’m still smiling. The guy at the bar is shocked that I am not fuming. Eh, the hourly pays my rent, but the night is not off the a very great start, mentally I have already thrown in the towel. \n\nSome time goes by and a bunch of friends come by the bar. Whiskey and ginger ale are flowing, 3 rounds of tequila, caesars and beer galore. I’m happy to be busy, I wasn’t expecting it on a Saturday (they’re quite hit or miss), but I’m getting into the groove and doing my best to chat and entertain while making drink after shot after drink. They all pay up and tip accordingly, some $1/drink, others just hit 15% on the machine, but I don’t think the night can really be salvaged despite the slight change in mood. \n\nMost file out apart from two from the busy group, they’re enjoying my caesars and my company. We talk about life and vacations and music and even politics, they invite me to their nearby cabin this summer and insist they buy me a shot tonight. It’s getting late and I’m tired but these folks truly are splendid, they settle up and add an extra 20% to the total, she leaves and few coins in exchange for limes for the tequila they have in their room, and then the husband asks for one more drink to bring upstairs. \n\nOne more ounce of whiskey and I give him a can of ginger ale for the road. Credit machine in hand, he types in the gratuity, shows the wife and she nods with a quick thumbs up, and presses “OK”. A receipt with a $50 tip, for one drink, prints in front of my eyes almost as if it were in slow motion. The tears are welling, and I barely manage a thank you before he says “this is one of the best experiences I’ve had at a bar, and you’re the bartender that made that possible.” \n\nReader, some days might seem like dead ends or write offs, but if you have the energy to keep smiling and think happy thoughts, maybe just a little bit of good karma will find its way to you.",

My last party of eight before we instituted this policy ran me for over an hour and left me just under $5. \n\nI have been bracing myself to hear people complaining about this policy for two weeks, and there has been almost  none of that. The first day, a party of nine saw the sign and asked the manager if that was actually the policy and when they were told yes, they threatened to leave and the owner and management let them go. Apparently the owner wants to start weeding out some of the cheap-ass customers that seem to love coming to our place. \nWe all usually make pretty good money so we sort of accept/endure those customers as part of the cost of doing business. But no more.\n\n\nThe first party of 11 that I served I was a single check and the person paying the bill handed me their card without even looking at the bill. I hesitantly informed her that this was actually my first time adding a gratuity per restaurant policy and I still wanted to ask her permission to put the 18% on. She replied with a very sharp \"NO\" and my heart sank a little. Then she went on to say \"I want 20%.\" At least half of the parties that I've auto-gratted have asked to add more. One woman tried to complain to the hostess when the tip was added to her portion of the split check because she had to ask twice for a to-go cup. I overheard her and offered to remove her $3 from the bill but she relented and we just let it be.\n\nSo far, there is a noticable increase in tip % against sales. We are incentivized to upsell and sales are up, but we are also experiencing an increase in business due to a temporary tourist influx in our area. Not sure how it will pan out in the long run. \n\n\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to talk to customers about this? Do you have a specific way of presenting the bill and informing them that the tip is included? \n\n\nAny experiences you want to share about adding gratuities automatically?\n\n\n\nUpdate: I got way more comments than I expected on this post! Thank you for the great advice and insight  from pros who actually know what they're talking about! Those who suggested I just force my boss to pay me more, well, they need to go work in a restaurant themselves and try that out. ",

If people aren’t tipping 20% then obviously I’m doing something wrong. But one of your individual tickets was about $130 (alcohol is expensive) after added gratuity. And you tipped me enough to make it $200 and wrote the nicest note on the back of the customer copy thanking me and telling me how much it meant to them and joking that they will remember it for a long time (assuming they remember the night!)—which my sentimental self is going to keep for a long time.

The holiday rush has been crazy, lots of birthdays and holiday parties and graduations, etc.\n\nMy last party of nine comes in dressed to the nines for a girl’s birthday. They ask for specific drink choices and prices, and I get them all promptly. Straws and lemons for their water, hot water so they can sanitize their cutlery, you name it. Also give them plenty of space because they’re taking lots of pictures (a few group photos which I take), again no problems. Both my manager and I ask multiple times if everything’s great (including their crazy modified food items) and they tell me it is.\n\nHere’s where things get bumpy. \n\nThey ask for split checks (against company policy but if I’m not busy I do it because it’s not that big of a deal) and they scooched around a lot so my seat numbers weren’t perfect. It took a few extra minutes to get everything separate, and I could tell they were getting frustrated. They keep pointing to the auto-gratuity and we’re talking to themselves about it. Finally, someone pulled me aside and asked to take off the gratuity (automatic 18% for parties of six or more which is stated on our website and menu that they all had). I tried my best to keep a smile on my face since someone basically said to my face that I don’t deserve to make a living, and grabbed my manager. She gave the spiel of auto gratuity, and that we won’t be taking it off. Some things I heard as my manager and I were running their payments:\n\n“If the tip is added this way then service should be on point”\n\n“Well I read the whole menu and saw nothing about that”\n\n“Well I didn’t like this I shouldn’t have to pay for tip on top of it”\n\n“Run this card, but don’t put a penny more on it”\n\nThey all asked for their food to be boxed up, so I had no knowledge things weren’t up to their standards. At this point my manager and I are just trying to get them out of here, so we take a couple things off the bill. It all worked out at the end and I’ve dealt with worse I just can’t get over what I could have done more to give them 18% worth of great service. In the end I know the service was good they just didn’t want to pay for it. Just having someone look you in the eye and say you don’t deserve your tip is rattling. I’m dreading going back in tonight. \n\nThanks for letting me vent, and we only have a couple weeks left of holiday craziness! Keep your chins up, everyone!",

Endless 10/15 tops the whole shift, and I find I generally make more money on smaller, more easily turned tables. But whatever, I'm a team player so I attack the shift with gusto.  \n\nOne of my parties was a 14 top family dinner. At the start of their meal the patriarch of the family, an elderly man of about 75(ish), told me \"Listen here now, no matter what they say this is all on one check and I'm paying it!\"  Ok cool, one check, no splitting, makes my job easier. They order, things are going smoothly. As I'm serving, doing refills, etc, I notice a lady at the table surreptitiously palm some folding money to old dude's wife, a very sweet and tiny elderly lady. A few minutes later on a different pass through I see it again, from another guest at the table. And then again. \n\nAt the end of the meal I present the check to the grandfather of the group. Total of about $220. He pays with a card, I bring it back and say my goodbyes, and his wife motions me to her side, grabs my hands and says \"Thank you so much sweetie!\" and palms me some cash so quick and easy you'd have sworn she was a magician. I tuck it quickly away, tell her \"You're Welcome\", and go on my merry way. \n\nTurned out she slipped me $50. And when I picked up the CC slip that her husband left behind he had left me a solid $5 on his $220 bill. Clearly this was not his family's first rodeo with him paying the bill. \n\nAnyways, kudos to that family for understanding how to tip, and how to do it without pissing Grandpa off. And a special shout-out to his wife who was cute as a button and might have been a Three-Card Monty dealer in her younger days. Made my night.",

Apparently I've been relegated to wench tonight. \n\nWhen I returned with drinks there was 10 dollars in singles sitting on the end of the table. The clown who was obviously in charge of this bubbly and outgoing crew had placed them there. He said to me gruffly, \"This is your tip tonight. You'll start off with 10, every time I think you screw up or do something I don't like I'm removing a dollar or two\" \n\nIn my head I said, \"I\"m not a stripper, I'm not dancing for your dollar\"\n\nWhat I really said, as I scooped up the singles and placed them back in his hand was, \"Sir, you want to hold on to this, the bussers might get confused and think it was left from the table before you. I will give you the same service I give all of my tables; excellent. At the end of your meal when the bill comes you can then decide what amount of tip you'd like to leave.\" And before he could respond I added \"Would you guys like to start with an appetizer?\" \n\nI could see in his face that he was going to object, but before he got a chance his wife, reading the situation correctly (that I wasn't going to put up with her husband's shit) gave me their app order and I was off to my next table. I watched him grumble at her while he put his money back in his wallet. They were tolerable for the rest of their meal not outgoing or friendly by any means, but they didn't request anything out of the ordinary or ridiculous. \n\nAt the end of the meal I ended up with a 9 dollar tip. Not sure what random wronging I could have done to lose that dollar, maybe it was throwing his bullshit back in his face, but I wasn't even mad, that was still 20%. \n\n**TL;DR customer wants a handy with a reach around, I give him a punch in the solar plexus instead**. \n\nEdit: spelling",

Only   a six top but they were big shots of a major local company, spent $1100 on a 1.5 L of wine, surf and turfs, after dinner cognac and scotch, the works. The guy picking up the tab, Billy, was a major wine-o and  complimented my suggestions for Chardonnay. He joked that I should buy a bottle for myself on his tab. I laughed it off but he brought it up again while I was serving after dinner drinks, he insisted I get a nice bottle for myself to take home. To take home!!! My boss said hell yes grab a good one. I was absolutely flattered. Grabbed a bottle of The Prisoner from orin swift and charged it to the check. As I was making cappuccinos in the server station Billy poked his head in and flashed his card but first asked that I step into the side hallway. I figured he was trying to be secretive of another guy in the party who said he was paying, but he slipped me a wad of $20s and said \"this is for you and only you. I know how restaurants chop up tips, I was in this business for a long time. You did a great job tonight merry Christmas.\" I stuffed cash in my pocket and swipe his heavy amex. Then he leaves a 25% tip on the card! \n\nI've been at this restaurant for over a year and I've gotten so close with BOH and they work so damn hard but they don't see the kind of returns on service that FOH does. They put up with bullshit from me (never on purpose!) and always make me delicious food and are so nice about it. Once Billy and friends left I counted my cash... $400. Floored. Absolutely floored. I walked in the kitchen and handed out a $20 to everyone I worked with saying and you get $20 and you get $20. I still had more than enough left for myself. BOH was confused and tried to refuse it but I insisted. They deserve a tip too! \n\nI hope to one day be comfortable enough financially to even do half what Billy did for my co-workers and me.

I had several duties (Hostess, waitress, clearing tables, bartender) for 13 hours a day, every day. Just finished high-school, and decided to spend some time before uni to get some extra cash. \n\n**What happened:** I've been on shift for about 9 hours and the dinner rush was just starting, with all my combined duties, I was exhausted and customers were being..customers. (Snapping their fingers at me to call me over, changing orders last minute, not giving me two shits, letting their kids run around like the tiny fucktrophies they are etc.) Whatever, perks of the job. \n\nIn comes in a middle-aged caucasian man who seemed quiet and pleasant enough. I sit him down, and he's never been in our restaurant before, so I recommend dishes, take his order and make small talk. Throughout his entire dinner, he gave me absolutely no trouble and every time I had a moment to spare, I made sure that he had everything he needed, and we actually started talking about his work, why he was in Malaysia, turns out he was from France. So we practiced our french together, and we both had a grand ole time. \n\nThe bill came, and unfortunately, I was busy with another table so I couldn't say goodbye to him personally, but I did give him a wave and a smile as he went out. He left a $5 tip on his $40ish meal. This is extremely rare as they don't practice tipping here, and it'll mostly be loose change. Heck, we'd be lucky to even get a dollar on a good day. \n\nNeedless to say, I hoped he would come back again one day. And he did. An hour later. I was hostessing at that point and he came up to the little podium (the one with the menus &amp; reservation book) with a bag in hand. It was from Godiva: uber fancy chocolates, and I joked that whoever got that was a super lucky lady. \nNo joke, he gave me the bag. He just handed it to me and said \"This is for you, it's for the amazing service that you gave me and for the nice chats that we had over dinner. It was the most pleasant dinner experience I've had since coming to this country.\" \n\nIt was like someone had pantsed me. My mouth fell open and I turned redder than a ginger in summer. I could barely stammer out a \"thank you\", but he understood and went on his merry way. \nNow, by this point, everyone (my \"colleagues\" and some diners) was staring at what just happened, and demanded what happened. I \"spark-noted\" the whole story and just..couldn't stop grinning. \n\nMy entire day was made. And the chocolates were DELICIOUS. \n\nTL;DR: Take candy from strangers. ",

(She nods) and until I messed up with the bill, service was good? (nods again) ok so it's my mistake, this is between me and you, so let me make it right. How much do you want? Twenty dollars? Forty dollars?\"\n\nShe starts looking really uncomfortable at mugging me all of a sudden. I fan out my float, it's not a lot. I was 23 and looked it too. \n\n\"Go ahead! What was the app, 13 dollars plus tax and tip? Here take twenty for now and you've actually made a few dollars tonight, right? Is that enough? Do you want more? You can have my whole wallet.\" And I politely try to give her more. \n\nShellshocked as fuck, she slowly takes the twenty out of my hand and walks out of the restaurant. Head hanging way down. \n\nSometimes it's very clear what people want and sometimes giving to them makes them see what is really happening- a grown woman is leveraging her bad attitude and emotions to \"win one over\" on some kid, some business, anything at all. \n\nI would've paid 500$ easily to never see her again, I got a good deal. I still am awestruck she had the gall to take it. Third worst customer of my life. \n\nGood luck to all my fellow servers in here.

I have day job, and have been working the restaurant until they hire to recover from a mass quitting due to clueless owner and GM.\n\nWent in a little early to try and talk some sense into owner and GM. I asked for another server, or at least to be allowed to auto grat. Shot down on both.\n\nParty starts to arrive, I introduce myself and newbie to lady in charge. She asks where the other servers for her party are, I explain we are it.  She is pissed. I tell her I already voiced concerns, she will have to take it up with GM. \n\nThey trickled in pretty slowly, we did a pretty fair job with drink orders. I had preset some dressings to try and make the salads go easier, and preset extra napkins, bread, etc. It went as well as it could go, but it was rough. New server was completely overwhelmed, head lady was rude, and they were not the most understanding party.\n\nIt ended up being 1 check, ( thank the restaurant gods). The total was just shy of $5000.00. She left $60.00 total tip. New server is crying in the kitchen, and the vein in my forehead is popping out. $60.00 doesn't even cover the bar tip out, let alone the bus or host tip out.\n\nHeated discussion between myself and the owner ensues, and it is clear she doesn't care I'm at negative money for the night, actually the week now. I tell her that I will not be returning. She switches gears, tries to \"reason\" with me. I give the new server the 60 bucks, tell the owner I will be calling the labor control board if I don't get paid minimum wage for the week. I tell her and the GM both how I feel about them (fucking incompetent douchebags), and out the door I go with both middle fingers in the air. Feels good.\n\nEdit: Whomever gave me gold, thank you So much for the tip!\n\nEdit: Thank you for the second gold! Also, thank you for the support.

More alcohol.  More alcohol for the first 2 as well.  This trend continued, but the teenagers were quickly gone, barely haven eaten anything.  More adults, more drinks, more leaving, more coming in.  I have an amazing management team, but I warned them this could be problems.  The first two did warn me about separate checks.  I told them I would deal with it later, but this table got chaotic.  I had random adult saying, \"Bring 3 more beers\" and then they were passing them out.  Finally at about the 3 hour mark the last two arrived.

At the 4 hour mark one says, \"I think we're ready for our checks.\"  I told them I would be over in a minute.\n\n\nNormally, split checks are not problem for me, but I've had countless people leave, and then more come in, a massive amount of liquor ordered...I'm at a loss.

I take notes of their answers, and it adds up to 19 people.  There's like 9 people left at the table, multiple teens who has eaten and left, some wives gone...I'll take their word on 19.  They were 2 short on their drinks guesses (most drinking the same draft beer), so I did those two on a separate check and asked who wanted them.  The nice guy picked those up.\n\n\nAll in all about a $1,000 tab, each guy left 20%, the nice guy dropping an extra $50 in cash.

    "text_content": "Hey TFR. I hope to cross-post this to r/talesfromyourserver a bit later, but for now I'm submitting to you guys as I'm heading to work shortly. Here's a tale from said work that occurred just the other evening.\n\nI'm a server at a popular 24-hour diner chain. I tend to work odd hours; this particular evening, it was from 11pm to 7am. These tend to be very slow hours at said diner. We can go hours without a single customer. Except for tonight. Lady and her son who looks to be no more than twelve come in for breakfast at midnight. They stay at the restaurant until 3am. Three hours. The worst three hours of my life. This lady behaves almost antithetical to how manners would dictate one should behave in public. She snaps her fingers at me, yells at me, calls me slow even though I'm running back and forth for her a million miles a minute, swears at me, and asks me if I'm pregnant multiple times (I'm a little heavyset, but I don't look THAT bad).\n\nAt 3am, I give her the bill. It's almost $100 for the two of them, because she ordered so much. She's flabbergasted.\n\nWitch Lady: \"What do you mean $98.79? You seriously think you're getting a tip after this, you little b*tch?\"\n\nMe: \"That is the bill, maam.\"\n\nWitch Lady: \"I'm outraged! I'm filing a report with the police! I'm writing to my congressman about this!\"\n\nHer poor kid.\n\nThey both leave and I don't get a tip. In fact, she was a penny short on her bill (I didn't realize until after she paid and left, but whatever).\n\nI really hope things go better today. I've requested that my manager ban her if she ever shows up again, but he didn't give me an answer.",

    "text_content": "Server of 6+ years here. Whenever I go out to eat, I make sure to tip a healthy amount (for obvious reasons), even when the service is below par. I understand people have their off days, could be new, and/or could be going through a lot in life. However, tonight I had the most horrible experience as a guest. I met up with my boyfriend and a few friends after my shift this afternoon for dinner. I arrive early and order everyone a water. I notice my server is the same server I had just the week before. When I had him last, he seemed weeded the whole time, forgetting to grab my beer that had been sitting at the bar for 20 minutes. Our food came out later than normal and it took us another 20 minutes to find him to ask for boxes. No worries, though, he’s just weeded. Tipped 25% and left. \n\nTonight was a totally different story. It wasn’t as busy as last week, so I figured it would be a quicker experience. After my boyfriend and friends arrived, he promptly came over and asked about appetizers. I insisted it would take us a few minutes to figure out an appetizer, so he left. My friends drink a lot of water, and in this time, they were almost done with their waters. Server comes back over. “I’ll grab some more water.” “Thanks” we said, and before I could announce that we had decided on an appetizer, he turns around. I said “excuse me! I think we also decided on this appetizer please. Thank you!” “Ok I’ll get that in for you,” he says. Minutes go by, no water refill. We notice him walking past our table numerous times to his other tables, still no refills. No worries, maybe he got weeded a bit. He comes back. “Are you ready to order?” “Yes,” we all say. We tell him all of our orders. My friend then asks if we can have more waters. “Yeah sure” our server says. He comes back a few minutes later with one water, not a pitcher. We all needed our waters refilled by this point, not just one person. We leave him be and think maybe he realizes and will be back with a pitcher. 10 minutes go by, nothing. 20 minutes go by, nothing. We constantly see him going back and forth to his other tables, but refusing to walk directly by ours.\n\n By this point, I’m wondering what’s going on with our appetizer. It was a simple appetizer that is ladled into a couple bowls and sent out with chips. Did he forget? Who knows. 10 minutes later, our appetizer finally comes out. It’s on the brink of being cold. It’s okay, we will eat it because we are hungry and it’s not that big of a deal, right? We remind him about the water refill. “Oh right” he said and walked away. By this time we have been there for 35 minutes. I can see it getting busier in the restaurant. We eat the appetizer and wait patiently for the water refill and our food. Another 15 minutes goes by and here comes our food. It’s mine and my boyfriends food. Looks correct and looks good. He leaves to go get the other half of the table’s food, or so I assumed. We realized after he left that we had no silverware also. That’s okay, we will tell him when he brings the other plates out. I see him exit the kitchen 5 minutes later, but with nothing in his hands. Where’s my friends’ food? I hear my friends sucking up what little water they still had in their cups from the ice melting. And where’s the water refill too? 15 more minutes go by, still no friends’ food or water. My boyfriend and I are trying to slow down eating for the respect of our friends who still don’t have their food. We ended up not eating anything more until their food comes out. We flag down our server and ask if they are ever going to get their food or water to which he replies “yeah it should be out soon”. I’m thinking, man, if this was me, I’d get a write up or even get fired over this… here it is now 25 minutes after my boyfriend and I got our food and my boyfriend is livid. Our food is cold from waiting and they still have no food or refills. My boyfriend goes to find a manager. He returns to the table and the manager he spoke with comes to the table with water refills almost immediately. We thanked her and asked about the food. She goes to check on it. \n\nMeanwhile, our server got word that we had spoken to a manager. He comes by the the table to take the empty glasses and with an attitude says, “we have 3 new cooks working back there, SO…” and walks off. What kind of excuse is that? I don’t care how many new cooks you have, my friends’ food should have came out at the same time as our food! We are the same table! 10 more minutes go by and we see our server approaching the table with a tray of food. Finally! We all get to eat! Until I realize it’s one entree and it’s not either of my friends’ food! He tries auctioning it off to our table. “Um, that’s not our food” my friend says. “Oh okay” says our server and goes to another table with that food. My friend is keeping track of how long it has been since my boyfriend and I had gotten our food. It as been 30 minutes. My boyfriend is fed up. And by this point, we are all ready to leave and my friends are wanting to eat elsewhere. My boyfriend gets up to ask for the manager to come by our table again. As soon as he gets back, here comes our server with our friends’ food. One of their entrees was incorrect, but they took it anyway. At this point, we all want boxes and just want to leave. Here comes the manager. A different one than who my boyfriend had spoken to earlier. She apologized profusely and aimed to make everything right. This was the first apology we had heard the whole night. We told her that it wasn’t her fault and thanked her. \n\nNeedless to say, I was absolutely appalled at the type of service we got. We would have been okay if all of our food took longer than normal, but my friends not having their food for 30+ minutes after ours was unacceptable. I honestly believe he forgot to ring theirs in somehow, but I still don’t know how that could have happened when we ordered at the same time. The whole experience took us 2 hours from start to finish. It was also the first time I had left a $0 tip to a fellow server. \n\nHas anyone else had an experience this bad?\n\n\nTL;DR: Fellow server here, had such a bad experience out to eat that I left $0 tip for the first time ever.",

    "text_content": "Hey all! I've subscribed here for awhile but never really post. I'm a former server, and I'll be honest I was kind of terrible at the job. (I'm not a huge people person.) So I enjoy reading tales from servers today. As a customer, I almost always tip generously, but having been in the industry before I do have a few pet peeves that will really make me reassess the tip during my meal.\n\nA big one? Being sat and then being *ignored studiously* by wait staff all around us even after our menus are down, and we've been clearly ready for ten minutes.\n\nWell, this happened to us right after the Boston Marathon and I wanted to share how I went from being silently furious, to tipping 25% of what our bill **would have been** had we been charged for the surprise free dessert we got after our meal.\n\nWe were at a very fancy restaurant, a steakhouse in downtown Boston. We don't often eat fancy, but this was a huge celebration for my husband who has trained for years to qualify for and run the Boston Marathon, and he'd finished it with a great time earlier in the day, so we made reservations for 6:30PM. We arrived 15 minutes early to a quiet restaurant, and were sat. We read through the menu, my husband went to the bathroom and returned. We chatted, and multiple waiters passed our table without so much as giving a glance toward my attempts at direct eye contact.\n\nMy husband, knowing this is my peeve, said, \"I'm sure we'll have someone soon.\" I said, \"For the price we're paying, we'd better.\" \n\nJust as I was about to hound the hostess asking where our waiter was, an older gentleman rushed by with his umbrella and overcoat on. He paused, \"I'll be with you both very shortly, I promise. I'm sorry for your wait.\"\n\nI watched him go into the kitchen (through the windows in the kitchen) from our table, and he continued rushing, pulling off his coat as he walked, and continued into the kitchen where I couldn't see him. Not two minutes later he was back, continuing to apologize, stating he had to run and get something during his break and he had asked they not seat his section right away. He saw my husband's Boston Marathon jacket and instantly said, \"Did you run?\" My husband said he had, and he instantly reached out to shake my husband's hand and offer a hearty congratulations. Then he turned to me and shook my hand as well. Then he settled down to business, asking if we wanted to hear the specials, etc.\n\nOur drinks came out quickly, and our salads right after. Because this restaurant was so high priced, he offered up that a single salad would and could be easily split among two, and he was right. We each received a huge salad on our plates. He also suggested we order half portions of the sides, if we wanted to try more than one, so we did.\n\nEvery last moment of our meal was professionally, personally, wonderfully handled. He even brought the manager by to congratulate my husband (Boston really loves the runners!) and our waiter and my husband bonded over living in the same neighborhoods for many years. My husband lived in Boston for 17 years before moving away 12 years ago, and this was his nostalgic return to run the marathon in the city he loved.\n\nBy the time our salads arrived, I was in love with our waiter. Gone was the frustration of waiting at the outset of the meal.\n\nWe enjoyed our steak and lobster, and wine and beer, and after a bit he came by with a dessert menu. My husband looked at me and we gave each other a, \"Oooof we can't eat another bite\" look. He and I started chatting and my husband said, \"I would probably puke if I ate something more. That chocolate cake looks good though, comes with ice cream. That always cuts the richness. Maybe I could handle that.\"\n\nWe chuckled, but it was clear we weren't ordering dessert.\n\nApparently our waiter overheard my husband, though, because a few moments later an enormous 7 layer chocolate cake slice, complete with a lit candle and scoop of ice cream ended up on our table! \n\nAt first I thought that the person who dropped it off had the wrong table until our waiter came back with a grin on his face and said, \"You have to celebrate your first race here in your old hometown!\" Big, hearty handshakes all around again, as we started to tuck into our cake.\n\nWe got the bill, sub-$200, but only by about $10 which was essentially the cost of the cake we got for free. I left a $50 tip, because I appreciated so much how well he took care of us.\n\nI know that TGIChilibees servers may not be able to comp a huge slice of cake, or treat someone ridiculously special during the course of a busy Friday night, but the thing that really stuck with me was that our server 1) immediately recognized we had been waiting, 2) acknowledged it as soon as he could 3) really **did** bust his butt to get back to our table to help us ASAP and 4) made sure we knew we were in good hands for the rest of the meal.\n\nI often feel like when someone's been late to my table at the outset, they feel like their tip is ruined, or we already have a bad perception of our service, and so it's not worth it trying to change that mindset, but really for me first impressions **can** be changed by an awesome, kind, friendly server.\n\nI just wanted to share this great experience in hopes that it makes up for some of the bitchy customers I know you guys have, and to help share that when it comes to restaurants and service, first impressions *don't always* ruin a customer's perception of the service throughout the whole meal.\n\nAnd as I always feel when I'm in this sub: Thanks to all of you who put up with the pain in the ass customers, who bust your butts, and who treat us well when we eat out. I know the job you do is tough. I couldn't hack it, so I live vicariously through your stories.",

    "text_content": "I am no longer a server, but was one all through college... I worked at a franchise of a chain of 24-hour restaurants that is notorious for cheap breakfasts and shitty service. Big yellow sign with red letters.\n\nLike all of you, I took great pride in my job and how I treated my customers. In all honesty, if I could find a server job that offered good insurance and steady tips, I would consider going back to it. I really, truly loved waiting tables and making people's lives a little more pleasant, at least while they were in my section. It sounds cheesy, but it's true.\n\nI had several 'regulars\" that always sat in my section, but there were other servers that had their regulars as well. One of them was a really pleasant, jovial man... and his horrible, nasty wife. She was the kind of woman who got off on being a bitch and making other people's lives miserable. One particular day, I had to cover some tables in a different server's section because a server called in sick. I was warned about this couple when they came in, but had never waited on them before so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. I was told that she had a habit of complaining endlessly about everything, demanding to speak to the manager every time they came in and berating the servers and cooks at every turn. The husband (who often came in by himself) was the opposite - friendly, good-natured, well-liked. \n\nAs soon as they were seated, before I could even get their drink orders, the husband got up from the booth and walked outside for a few minutes, leaving me alone with the wife. I put on my best smiley, cheerful face and greeted her.  She refused to make eye contact with me and instead scowled and snarled, \"You would think that, as much money as we spend here, you people would know what we like to drink!  Why do we have to keep going through this?  I want ICED TEA, NO LEMON!!\". She didn't tell me what the husband wanted, and I didn't ask... I was just so taken aback by the anger straight out of the gate that I just turned on my heels and walked away.\n\nI poured her an iced tea - NO LEMON!! - and brought it back to her. Before I could even set it down, she snapped, \"I already know what I want to eat, and we're in a HURRY.\" (bear in mind that the husband is still outside). I took her order, still trying to be pleasant, and before I could walk away she snarled \"and the last time you people brought the food out, it was COLD!!  I do NOT want cold food!  And I want EXTRA CHEESE on my scrambled eggs!!  and SALSA!!\". Her voice seemed to drip with more and more anger with every word she spat out.\n\nAs I was ringing up the order, I thought of a thousand things I wanted to do, then I hit up on an idea... instead of getting back at her, I was going to not only go out of my way to make her meal as perfect and delicious as possible, but I was going to embarrass her as well.\n\nI made sure everything was perfect... piping hot, lots and lots of cheese on the eggs, fresh salsa warmed up to room temperature. By the time the meal was ready, the husband had returned to the table and was happily chatting with one of the servers. I mustered up my best scared/sad face as I brought out the food to her. As I sat it down, I started to tear up, just a little, and expressed in gushing, flowery terms how sorry I was for how badly she was treated the last time she was here, and how hard I worked to make sure the food was absolutely 100% according to her specifications, and that I felt SO BAD for how she was treated the last time she was here, that I was going to pay for her meal out of my tips and how I hoped that she would be willing to accept my apology on behalf of the whole restaurant for her miserable experience. I really laid it on as thickly and sweetly as I could.\n\nHer husband, who was happy and smiling and cheerful just seconds ago, stared her down with a sick, horrid look, his face turning bright red. She was MORTIFIED, her face turning equally red... she hung her head and said, \"ummm.... okay...\". I asked her if everything was to her satisfaction this time, and if it wasn't, I would rectify it immediately. She stared at her plate, pushed it around a bit, and said, \"ummmm... yeah...\". The husband is staring her down, clenching his jaw. He politely ordered his meal and as I was walking away, I heard him hiss at her, \"what did you say to her? What did you DO??\".\n\nShe was silent and sulking for the rest of the meal, and he was polite but not overly chatty. When they were finished, she stormed out before he even left the table, head hung. He apologized profusely to me for how she had acted and left a generous tip on top of paying the tab. To the best of my recollection, she never acted like a bitch to any of us ever again.",

It wasn't, because this was the first I'd heard about. Host later said she straight up told them that drink orders were not her job today and the server would be right over.\n\nNo fewer than three boomers came up behind me at the server station and grabbed my arm to tell me that the downstairs toilet wasn't flushing properly. We know. It's 100+ year old plumbing. We always end up having to close that bathroom on this weekend. You do not need to lay hands on me to convey this information.\n\nGuy announces he is going to the food vendor outside to get french fries for his wife and he'll be right back. No, sorry you can't have outside food in here. He gets Big Mad, pouts and glares and tips like shit.\n\nThis couple was mildly rude/weird since they sat down on the patio. Lady ordered a thing and when I put it down, she was like \"I thought this was X, not Y\". It isn't, this is Y, it's what you ordered, but I can get you X in about five minutes. No, she said, I'll eat it. Then as I'm dropping their credit slip, the husband and I both watch a gay man in a fabulous outfit walk by. I smiled - probably my only genuine smile of the day - because this person looked fantastic and carried himself with beautiful confidence and I was like hell yeah for you, friend. And then I turned and saw the husband's face. It was contorted into the most hateful rage I've ever seen up close. I got the fuck away from that. He tipped $5 on $70.\n\nI'm dead tired and needed the vent. What Memorial Day bullshit are you weathering this weekend?",

I mention this because any amount of inventory given away is a real slap in the face to the owners, who are kind and hard working people. \n\nThe other day a guy who I’ve served a handful of times comes in. I typically work Friday-Sunday at this place, and he only comes in on weekdays during his lunch break so I don’t see him that often. He always orders a glass of red wine, in a small beer glass instead of a wine glass, and gets his lunch to go. \n\nSo on this day, I pour him his wine (we have very tiny wine carafes that measure the wine to 6 ounces, then we pour the wine from the carafe to the glass) and when I go to hand it to him, this is our conversation:\n\nDude: You should fill that glass up all the way. \n\nMe: Oh I measured the pour, it’s the right amount.\n\nDude: I know but you could just fill the glass up, Jenny (other server who works alone Monday-Thursday lunches) always does for me. *chuckles* Probably because I’m such a good tipper!\n\nMe: umm, okay well you’re putting me in an awkward position. I’m giving you the amount you paid for, so I don’t really know what to tell you. Jenny technically shouldn’t be doing that. \n\nSo dude walks away and goes outside to smoke like he usually does while waiting for his food. When he comes back inside to pick up the order and pay, I explain to him again that he put me in a tough position because now I look like the bad guy who won’t give him extra wine when in reality I’m just doing my job properly. He says he doesn’t want to get Jenny in trouble (no shit, then you won’t get extra wine anymore) and that he understands (doesn’t seem sincere though) \n\nHe left me $3 on $26.\nSmh. \nIf you want to take care of your regulars, buy them a drink with your own damn money.

She had a good amount of reservations and I was excited to finally see the restaurant busy because the day before it was insanely slow. Anyways, she gets sat with a 6 top and I’m shadowing her then she gets sat with a 2 top and asks if I wanna give it a shot! I don’t know the menu very well but it’s our brunch menu so I go for it. It goes super well and their tab came out to be 40$ and they left me a 15$ tip. great! After, She gets sat with a 6 top, and another 2 top and asks me to take the 2. Sure no problem! It goes super well, their tab was 50$ and they left me a 26$ tip which was a huge confidence boost and I was feeling really good.\nNow this is where I get confused. She gets sat with an 11 top of some older ladies and another 5 top and I’m shadowing her and helping her get drinks, then her next reservation of 9 people comes really early. She’s in the weeds and asks if I can greet the 9 top and take their drink order. Sure! So I do that and then she ends up asking if I can just take the whole tables order and she will help with any questions I may have. I oblige and do that, and do it well. I think I forgot to add cheese on one persons eggs. I tell them they’re my 3rd table and thank them for being so patient and they told me I’m doing a really good job, overall they were super sweet. I close them out and they’re on their way. So they end up leaving and I start bussing the table and I peak at the tab. 240$ and they left “me” 60$. Which is a very nice tip and I’m happy about it ( even though I know I’m not getting it because I’m training. I leave it on the table and a couple minutes go by and I notice the tab is gone so I catch A and ask her just out of curiosity, how did I do on that table? Was the tip alright? She looks at me and says, “ yeah you did okay! It was about 35$!” \n\nWhy did she lie? I don’t understand. I told my mom and a close friend and they think it’s because she didn’t want to share the money, which I wasn’t expecting but why would she want me to think I did worse than I actually did? It hurt my feelings because I really felt nervous about taking a big table so soon but I wanted to help her out because she has been so sweet and I even considered being friends with her. Does anyone have any clue why she’d lie to me? :(  anytime I have trained a server in the past if they took a table and did everything for them I’d atleast give them half of the tip. I’m just at a loss. Now I feel like I can't trust this person. Any advice or insight would be appreciated! \n",

    "text_content": "To start, I will say I was pretty happy to be working. I've been hustling up shifts left and right.\n\nI was scheduled for a patio shift that night (Sunday). But, I had a feeling I'd get called off since it was overcast that day. Well, I got a call after leaving the gym and answered to the voice of my manager asking me to come in an hour early. Woo!\n\nOne of the veteran servers volunteered to stay home since it looked less busy than expected that day, but since it picked up they decided to reschedule the section and just put me there instead. Totally fine. I'm always willing to work.\n\nSundays are steady. Mostly after church families. We don't get a lot of Sunday Funday types. We are surrounded by locally owned eateries that take up all that business and we are a corporate chain. Fine by me. I worked at one of the smaller ones for a while under the owner from hell. I'm kind of weird and appreciate the structure and organization a lot of corporate companies have. It's always been a more comfortable environment for me and I could never understand why.\n\nBack to the story. I'm supposed to get phased out pretty early because I'm also supposed to break the closer that night. Hostess walks up and tells me I'm done and hat the manager said to break the closer. So, I head over and the closer looks at me and says, \"How about I break you? I don't feel lime closing and I know you want to work.\" Deal.\n\nWe inform the manager and get to it. My manager pulls me aside and tells me that for the past few weeks a 10 top has been coming in late. They are a theatre group of sorts, older. They all want split checks and order lots of booze and stay late. He said they aren't the best tippers, but they tip around 15%. I shrug and figure it can't be that bad.\n\nFast forward to 10:15PM. We close at 11 on Sundays. The backwaiter has started to clean to line and dumped out most of the rice and keep the rest in a warm tray. I tell him to wait just in case, he said it was plenty of rice and it would be fine. I shrug it off. He usually does a good job so I'm fine with his decision.\n\nThey walk in. The hostesses have all been cut. So my manager and the other closer who is finishing her sidework set up the party. I have 5 other tables at this point. 1 has the check dropped. 1 is on dessert. 1 is closed and hanging out. 2 are finishing up apps and I've just fired their entrees in the kitchen. I go up to them and swap out their dirty things for fresh plates, grab refills, and let them know I'm about to go MIA and nod over to the new party. They laugh and understand. *phew*\n\nI turn around and the back waiter has already brought out a big tray of water. Usually this is a big no-no unless the water is ordered, but it depends on who is managing. The manager at the time wanted to keep them occupied until I could get over there to start drinks. So, waters it was. He's a new transfer from a store that closed down and i couldn't be happier. He's level headed, funny, and encouraging. I had a bit of a rough run the night before and every time i messed up i went to him and he just told me shit happens and to keep busting my ass as i always do and that I'm doing solid work.\n\nBefore i can even get past the big table to grab a couple last things for my tables who I'm about to go MIA on, i get waved down and orders are getting thrown at me without so much as me being able to say, \"I'll be with you in one moment, my friends.\" Off we go.\n\nMultiple people inform me to split the check, one reminds me of the Moscow Mule she had last week that didn't have enough ginger. She asks if i remember. I didn't even close that week. I tell her no but i inform her that I'm on it.\n\nWell, we've all had trickle-in parties. They didn't do that. They arrived together. 14 of them. But they all ordered at different times. I made a good 5 different runs to the bar for the first round alone. I've got a lot of energy and have had a good night, so I'm okay at this point. My manager is checking on my other tables for me. Every time I try to escape, they wave me down and want more. Luckily, the other tables all understood and even left pretty good tips.\n\nNow, drinks are all on the table and I've already started taking orders for round 2. The other closer decided to stick around for a bit until the group settled in. She's been getting me refills on water and non-alcoholic drinks.\n\nI work with mostly amazing people who always look out for each other. The vets help me out a lot because they know I want to work and I'm always their go to guy if they want a night off. In return, they always have my back in tight situations. My managers (mostly) love that shifts and hours make me more giddy than a kid in a candy store. They also have my back.\n\nI finish off bringing the 2nd round and someone asks when I'm going to start taking food orders with some snark. I smile (genuinely, because the further along we move, the closer I get to getting them out - it is 10:30 at this point) and bust out my book and pen.\n\nEach order. EACH order of food. All 13 of them (1 person was just drinking) had a modifier. Often times a mod that I could only type in. There was on specific Asian lady who liked to snap and point at me who's food was modified quite a bit.\n\nI manage to take all food orders in one round, match them all to the drinks according to seat numbers in Aloha, get them fired off at the same time, and not have any voids due to my own faults. I had one void of a change in order because she didn't enjoy her food and sent it back (aka dinner for the back waiter and me).\n\nAt this point, I head back and start clearing empty glasses and getting another round of alcohol. Shortly after, entrees hit the table and they start eating.  I go off to bus my other tables who have now gone. Every time I try... They call my name and want more stuff.\n\nIt is now 10:45. We are supposed to close in 15 minutes. Faces in the kitchen are grim. Though, finally, the party has settled for a bit and I can munch a little in the back.\n\nAfter a minute or two I head back out and people start asking for boxes. I grab a bunch and start boxing food. The box requests have also come in the trickle-in format. I make multiple box runs.\n\nAt this point I've become gassed. I was running circles for the party. I went into fuck it mode and figured I'd clean the other tables altogether after they leave.\n\nAs I box food I hear someone mention fortune cookies. Before I can say anything I look up and Ms. Snap-Her-Fingers Asian lady is grabbing cookies from the server station.\n\nTHERE IS NOTHING THAT ANNOYS ME MORE. That is a station for WORK. Get the fuck out of there!\n\nNow everyone has cookies. Whatever. It's 11:15. Two people flag me down and want to-go food. The kitchen is already halfway shut down. They have to reopen a few things and cook. Groans are heard (can't blame them). I finally get the last orders out and the food boxed.\n\nThey ask for the checks. I print them out all 1-by-1, put them in books, and send them out. Trickle-in payments. 1 here\n 3 there. 1 here. 1 there. 7 there, etc.\n\nSlowly but surely, I get them all closed out. They even swarmed a bit because they were \"in a hurry.\" which obviously doesn't explain why they were all there still at 12:15.\n\nFINALLY. At 12:20, they trickle out. The cleaning crew is already there and working. I plop down for a bit to breath. I close all the checks, adjust the tip entries, and run my check out so he can get into the office and start closing down the system. At this point, the dishwashers have already turned off and cleaned the washer for the night. I had to leave 4 bus tubs full of glassware and plateware for the morning crew.\n\nThe cleaning crew help me reset the dining room and wipe down the tables. Finally, I settle into the back and finish up closing sidework. Marry glass racks, break down soda machines, pull fresh glassware to the Bev stations, etc. I burn the ice, wipe down the line and FINALLY clock out at 12:50am. Just 9 minutes before I hit over time. The cleaning crew and kitchen were already long gone. I take the elevator to the basement (too tired at this point to want to deal with stairs) and head to the office to hand in my clock out. My manager was surprised I was still willing to be so thorough with closing work and that he's almost never seem a server in the building after cleaning crew leaves.\n\nHe asked how they tipped. I shrugged and said exactly how he told me they would. Not bad, but not great. He laughed and told me if it made me feel any better I managed to accrue 33 hours this week (CA servers get state min. wage so hourly is a nice addition to tips). It was a good feeling when so many others are complaining about not working enough (yet, not piping up to mgmt or asking others for shifts).\n\nHe thanked me, told me to enjoy my day off, and I headed back up. I got on my bike and did my usual 9 block cruise home, dodging club rats and bar hoppers half the way.\n\nWhat a shift. What crazy people. Probably gonna do it again next week",

I go over to greet her and she goes “FramingHips, right? I thought I remembered your name.” \n\nThe guy gets defensive and is like, “oh you guys seem pretty friendly...?” \n\nShe then points to the guy and goes “this is my *friend,* I met FramingHips today and told him we were having a little *friend* date.”\n\nWell, I saw the blood drain from this dude’s face. I’m thinking oh god, this dude thinks he’s on a date and she just friend-zoned him in front of me, and I’m “the other guy” to him and I don’t even know this girl. And now I have to serve them. \n\nWell, after that, rather than being a machismo bro, this guy started being really buddy-buddy with me, talking about how great of a job I was doing, how great of a tipper he is, yadda yadda. I’m like I get it dude, you’re trying to save face. \n\nAfter awhile we all get more comfortable, and the awkwardness sort of dissipates between jokes. Then they call me over to ask me a question about polyamory versus monogamy, and if I’d ever had a threesome. \n\nI’m a pretty wild and crazy guy so I humor them and open up a bit. It’s a slow night, all the guests are happy, paid, or both, so I can spend some time chatting. We get a nice rapport going, I learn to dude is bi, oh that’s cool, and I’m like alright where is this night going...? Am I going to have a threesome later?\n\nCutting through the awkwardness, I end up kind of becoming friends with this guy, in a weird way, and sort of lose any interest in the girl completely. The more I talked with her I was like oh alright, she’s kind of a bitch. Golden rule kinda thing, would I even want to be with a girl who shut down our date in front of a stranger? This guy though, he’s funny and nice, good looking, seems like he’d be a pal. \n\nSo at the end of their night she goes to the bathroom and I start chatting it up with this guy about how embarrassing the whole situation seemed in the beginning. Guy is super cool, he’s like “yeah man turns out she has a boyfriend anyway, jokes on us, but I live up the street if you wanna grab a beer sometime.” He tipped 25%.\n\nFunny thing is they friended me on Facebook after. \n\nEDIT: he just passed my job and ducked in with his buddy to say hey and we made a beer date haha ",

Group of adults comes in, I do an OK job taking care of them. Nothing special about the meal, the party, or the service. I give them the check, run the card for the first charge (before the tip, I don't know what you call that) and hand them the slip, they finish up, sign it and leave, and as I'm cleaning the table, I look at the slip. \n\nMeal charge was something like 93, and the tip is listed as 15. But at the bottom, it says total: $99. I figured their math was bad, and 5% would have been ridiculous, so I ran it for $108. Next shift I get called into the office for stealing from a customer, and he shows me the slip.  I had to pay back the $9 to get it down to the total. But ... wtf? The customer didn't express any problems and the tip was written at a low but reasonable rate. So they're cheaping out on the tip but making it LOOK like they're being generous? Or maybe they were just bad at math. But if they were bad at math, they sure had the presence of mind to know what the total would have been. I don't even write on the customer copy of my restaurant receipts, I would never even know the server had changed it if it were me. And it's not like someone else at the table was pranking them by adding a 1 to the 10s column on the tip, because it didn't go from 5 to 15. \n\nManager wasn't mad, and I wasn't given any reprimand, he was just like \"Yeah people are dumb, don't fix their math, just run the bottom line.\" Anyone ever get this?",

Rushes near the end of my shift before second shift arrives. Being stuck an hour+ after my scheduled out time to do side work. \n\nThe day before this incident took place I worked a 12 hour shift to help cover a call off. Then I was back at work at 8am the next day, when this took place.\n\nMy first table — they were initially going to be a 6 top which is great because we put 20% auto gratuity on them. But only 5 showed, so no auto gratuity. Service went very well and the table were friendly people. I had a feeling this table would be a good start to my day and hopefully turn around this frustrating week. They had run up a $160 check which is high for breakfast; I was excited. \n\nThe (assumbly) grandfather asks for the check, I run his card, drop the check, wish them well and send them on their way. A few minutes later I see them walk out of the restaurant but I’m mid delivering drinks and just got sat. Within about 3 minutes I’m able to go to the table to pick up the signed receipt. BUT IT IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. The check presenter is sitting there with the customer copy and there’s no cash on the table. Being 99% sure the grandfather accidentally took the signed copy I immediately full on sprint out of the restaurant and book it to the elevator downstairs. But I couldn’t find them in the lobby or down the hall right away so I had to go back.\n\nAt this point tears are welling and I’m doing my best to hold it together until I can get BOH. When I got back all of the BS from this week hit me and that receipt was my final straw. I was very visibly upset and my amazing coworkers came to help me right away. The other server gave me a hug and checked on my tables. I went to the bathroom to splash some water on my face and gather myself. I was better after 5 minutes, but still very upset that I lost out on ~$30 because of something so stupid and that my day had such a sour start again. \n\nI continued about my day, although frustrated and somewhat frazzled. A few hours later near the end of the chaos one of the food and beverage managers is making rounds on the venues and stops in mine. I tell him what happened and he asks to see the check. I still had the check presenter saved sitting near the POS, exactly how it was on the table. He moves the check side to side in the light and saw the pen impressions of the tip and signature. He told me it’s good enough for me to get the tip and that they left me $40. I was so happy I literally started crying tears of joy. I was very thankful for my manager and coworkers!\n\nTL;DR: Table walks out with merchant copy. I thought I lost out on $30 and was very upset. Later manager looks at check and sees pen impressions of tip and signature and I end up with a $40 tip.",

I’ve had a rough summer between the off season and health issues so I virtually made no money from mid June-mid September which doesn’t help pay my bills. \n\nWe all typically have a good feeling about certain tables and if they’re going to tip or not.

They had 2 friends join them towards the end of the meal, and I was really hoping another one would show up because I would able to add an automatic gratuity if they were a party of 6. \n\nThe night goes on and they’ve been with me for a total of 3 hours. I went to my boss and asked him if we could add the auto grat because their bill was $350 and climbing. And I just had this horrible sinking feeling they were going to stiff me. He said we couldn’t and even my other coworkers were like hey they’re going to fuck her over. Time comes for the bill and they split it. One girl handed me $20 bill and the others signed their slips. Our policy is to grab the checks while they’re on the table after being signed to say a pleasant goodnight spiel. I do so and see how they all didn’t leave me a single tip. \n\nI got a 5% tip for 3 hours of work and lost out on $100 between them not tipping and having to still tip out. I was absolutely fuming pissed. So I went and took the $20 and put it back on their table and said have a good night and walked back inside. A few minutes later I get all 5 of them running in yelling at me about how disrespectful and rude I am. \n\nI blankly looked at them and told them “I’m sorry you perceived it that way but I find it disrespectful and disgusting to tip a server 5% when they just busted their ass off for you for 3 hours.” \n\nThey tried to yell at me and say why didn’t I come and ask for more tip then why be “shady”. I said that I shouldnt have to come and ask why I wasn’t given a proper tip when you yourself told me how amazing of a server I was for you, and that maybe next time don’t let your man order 6 $25 cocktails. If you can’t afford to tip don’t go out to eat. \n\nMy manager was there for the whole thing and kinda let me say my peace at least. Their only complaint to him was me slamming the money down on the table. They even confirmed I was a good server. And yet still left me nothing. But it felt so good to tell them off. Because this is not okay to do to servers.\n\nEdit to add; if all your going to say is “your boss owes you a living wage” seriously stop. I’m legit doing the absolute best I can at a place that typically makes me good money. I can’t fix the US system so stop blaming my Owner when he’s legit trying to pay us more hourly currently.",

The clientel at this restaurant is generally business people, families, and people on dates. \n\n\nA few months ago, I was working on a Saturday night when a couple was sat in my section. Immediately, I noticed that they looked a bit out of place. The husband was wearing a t-shirt and jeans and the wife was sporting a similar outfit. No big deal, looks can often be deceiving. \n\n\nI give them the normal welcome spiel and dropped off a drink menu. The wife asks me quite a few questions regarding our white wines, and I bring her a sample of my favorite. She said it was good, and then asked for a Miller Lite. \n\n\nThey ordered their food and they seemed nice enough, but they were fairly unresponsive when I tried to chat with them. Again, no big deal. Some people like their space. \n\n\nAt one point, the wife's fork falls and I replace it. They cash out, and tip 15%. Annoying, but whatever. \n\n\nCue Monday morning. I walk up to my manager's office, and he asks if I remember a couple that sat at table 24 last Saturday night. I said yes, obviously nervous that they had complained about something that they hadn't told me about. \n\n\nMy manager is literally holding back laughter as he says,\n\n\"They called and told me that they couldn't enjoy their dinner because the wife's fork fell to the ground not once, but twice. They said that the floor had to be magnetic, and it's all they've been talking about since.\"\n\n\nWe both burst out laughing.\n\n\nComplaining about magnetic floors is the most creative complaint I have ever, and probably will ever, hear.\n\n\nEdit: 1. No, I wasn't assuming these people were shit because of what they were wearing. We just don't get people in casual clothing often, so they stood out. Many fine-dining restaurants won't seat people in casual clothing, but we don't have a dress code.\n\n2. As a server for 6 years, 20% has been known as the standard tipping amount for quality service, while 15% has become \"less than quality service\". In fine dining this is more of the standard than in fast-casual dining, at least in my experience serving in both environments, but I never (personally) tip less than 20% to a server regardless of the restaurant unless it was really bad service.\n\n\nEdit #2: In this restaurant, 18% is suggested gratuity. It says so on the bill. 22% is added to the bill in parties of 20 or more. My last hourly check was $0.20. My car payments, my rent, my tuition, and my general well-being relies on the tips I receive. The same case goes for most all servers in the U.S. Until the tip system changes, 20% is the (general) standard, and it's what keeps servers like myself afloat.\n\n\nEdit #3: I posted this because I thought that having a complaint about MAGNETIC FLOORS was pretty ridiculous and others would agree. Why is everyone making this entire post a debate!?",

My restaurant is operated on a no-reservations basis, so every time I save them a table I’m breaking the rules.

Most of my tables are sweethearts, everything is coming out of the kitchen on time, etc. In walks my entitled family, and they proceed to run me absolutely ragged for 2.5 hours.

I have all of their drinks in and on the table, and Im now starting to get food orders. Some people are being super annoying and getting up and moving around, but I'm managing.\n\nSo im like 10 people in, and then they tell me its going to be all separate checks. LOL - No its not. I tell the guy whose like \"in charge\" that with a party this large I can only do 1 check. My manager agrees with me that we arent going to split that fucking bill up, especially after theyve all been switching seats and ordered a whole bunch of shit already. So he gives me a card, and just tells me to keep him up to date with the total. No worries - PHEW.\n\nAnd I take the orders, put them in, and then a little bit later go around to check on drinks, its super hard to get peoples attention, so I'm going 1 by 1, and next to me, MAYBE a foot away, a girl goes \"Where the fuck is our server\" and I just pop my head next to her and say \"Shes right here. What can I get for you.\" she looks embarrassed, as she should be, because - what the fuck? She wants a drink. Done.\n\nAnyways, its just a super demanding table, and i have to turn down other tables from the hostess because I wouldnt be able to handle this table plus more than maybe 2 other small tables.\n\nFood starts coming to the expo line, so I go to take mine (and i know theyre mine because they had super specific mods), and another server tries to fucking take my food to his table. And I stop him and say \"No dude, this is for my table, here's my ticket\" and he tries arguing with me, and im showing him the mods, and hes still not backing down and the kitchen comes out to tell him that it is indeed mine. So now hes YELLING at me \"Why are all these fucking dishes up here! Take your plates! What are you doing?!\" and i LOSE it yall.\n\nI scream back \"Im TRYING to take my fucking dishes, but youre sitting over here BITCHING and FUCKING around and not LISTENING.

Servers are people, they make mistakes, they forget things, and sometimes we’re run so ragged pulling overtime hours for shit pay. Did you know most of us make $2.15 an hour? So yes, anything under a 20% tip, most of us consider a “stiff”\n\nSECOND. We do not get to keep all our tips. The place I work, management expects us to pay for others paychecks. That means our hosts, bussers, hell even our dishpit gets fucked. They make way less hourly because management wants our tips to go to them so they get to pay them less under that excuse. That being said, a big table comes in, $200+ and you leave 10-15%? You’re fucking me, my host, my busser, and my dishpit because the less money I make? The less they make. You think $20 is worth all the crap of the cooks trying to get your food out in a timely manner, causing that many dishes to pile up that the dish has to rush to turn around just so we can set the table for the next party, the busser scrambling to make the table look nice including a quick vacuum because your crotch goblins spilled food everywhere, and the host going out of their way to top off your drinks was worth it? $20 for four+ people isn’t considered a “stiff” to you?\n\nAnd THIRD. People have to wait. Yes, things are getting better, but for the next three days I will be your only server for that time slot. If you all expect to just walk in and have a nice sit down meal IMMEDIATELY? You’re dead wrong. I’m busting my ass bringing 11 more ranch and running drinks to 53 and apps to 42 but fuck! 41’s order is up and I can’t let that sit in the window because it’ll go bad, but I also have to type in the order for 31 because they all ordered burgs done different temps and with different cheeses and sides and our system sucks so now I have to go tell the kitchen this person doesn’t want this on their burger because I don’t have an option to type that in. And I swear to god I am RUNNING trying to get everything out to people. So I’m sorry you just walked out instead of giving me those extra ten minutes.\n\nI’m just sick of using this sub to rant and just get nasty comments from those of you who have no clue what it’s like to work in a restaurant.

For context I’m 26 but I look much younger and I’m also kind of socially awkward - like sometimes it takes me a second to realize someone is joking. It normally works out because I look young so it plays into the whole “young naive girl server” stereotype. It’s a slow Sunday night around 7 PM and I’ve been there since 11 AM and didn’t get home until almost 1:30 on Saturday night so to say I’m sleep deprived is an understatement.\n\n\nOn my way to the kitchen with some dishes I see an older lady get sat at one of my tables and the host puts down three menus at the table. I go ahead and get 3 app plates and some complimentary bread for the table.\n\nMe: Hey my name is philaenopsis, I’ll be your server tonight. Can I get you started off with a drink or appetizer while you wait for the rest of your party to arrive?\n\nLady: I’ll go ahead and take a water. My son might order some mozzarella sticks when he gets here but I’m not sure (not the actual appetizer because if I said the appetizer it would give away where I work. For the sake of the story the app is mozzarella sticks.)\n\nMe: Awesome, I’ll be right back with your water\n\nThe rest of the party arrives, it’s the lady’s husband and their grown son. He looks like he’s probably in his early-mid 30s. I go ahead and get their drink orders and bring them out.\n\nMe: Alright, and were we still thinking about getting an appetizer or we ready to order entrees?\n\nSon: Well I want some mozzarella sticks but I don’t want a whole appetizer. Is there any way for me to get a smaller portion?\n\nMe: Well we do have a burger that comes with mozzarella sticks so there may be a way for me to ring them in as an add on in a smaller portion. Let me go check with my manager.\n\nI’m looking on the POS to see if there’s any option to add on mozz sticks on any of the add on screens. My manager confirms the only way to get mozz sticks is to either get the app or the burger. I go back to the table\n\nMe: I’m so sorry, unfortunately the only way to get mozz sticks is to order the burger or the appetizer.\n\nAt this point the son gets really intense, almost seems angry. He starts making aggressive eye contact with me.\n\nSon: Well I don’t want a full appetizer but I’m going to have mozzarella sticks\n\nMe: So you wanted to do the burger then…?\n\nHim: No I don’t want them on a burger, but I’m going to have mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks are the only reason I come here, they’re so good.\n\nMe: so then did you want to order the appetizer? I’m confused.\n\nWe go back and forth like this a few times, him insisting he’s going to get mozzarella sticks but doesn’t want the burger or the app. I keep explaining to him those are the only two ways to get mozzarella sticks until he finally gets frustrated and says forget it and he needs a minute with the menu. I go back to the back and tell my manager about the situation, mostly venting about how rude this guy is being to me. She goes and talks to the table, comes back and tells me she’s giving him a few mozzarella sticks on the house but asked that they tip generously since they didn’t get charged. I go back to the table to get their orders, they have a few questions about the menu which I answer. The mom gets a a ceasar salad and dad gets a small sirloin.\n\nSon: If I wanted a cheeseburger with bacon how would you recommend I order it?\n\nMe: well we have two burgers on our menu and the both come with cheese by default and you can add bacon to either. One of the burgers comes with mozz sticks and you said you love the mozz sticks so I’d recommend you get that one.\n\nHe rolls his eyes.\n\nSon: no, I’ll just do the regular burger with American and bacon, no onion no lettuce extra pickles and tomato with ketchup and mustard.\n\nNow we’ve just switched over to tablets instead of taking orders in a traditional book. The way our POS is you have to ring in all the mods for an item before you can ring anything else in. He gave me his order pretty quickly and I’m sleep deprived so I ask him to repeat his order. I ring it in and read it back to him to make sure I got it right, at about the same speed as he gave me the order initially. He stares at me for a few seconds.\n\nSon: I’m sorry, I comprehended none of that. I’ve had a really bad day.\n\nI’ve had five hours of sleep and I’ve been double sat what feels like all night by our idiot host but ok dude. Anyway the rest of the visit is uneventful. They camp at my table for a couple of hours which isn’t a huge deal, it’s slow and I’m closing so I have to be there anyway. 30 minutes before close I’m sweeping my section and resetting my other tables. I overhear him talking about how he wants to open a tiki bar and get into the restaurant business and whatnot. I sincerely hope he doesn’t considering he was a huge douchebag to me all night. Ended up tipping $7 on a $35 ticket for the whole table when they sat there all night and he got free mozzarella sticks out of it. Oh well.",

So many people will order a huge amount of food and just leave half of it untouched and because of covid blah blah blah all we can do is scrape it into the bin. It makes me feel so shit standing in front of some of the kitchen staff who are working a minimum wage job to support their families and parents and siblings and having to scrape an entire plate of food into the bin because people just decided to order a huge meal and eat an eighth of it \n\nSecondly, people are such dicks. The amount of people who treat you like you’re less than them because you’re working as a waitress blows my mind. Last week we had a woman come in with her daughter and a bunch of other kids to celebrate her birthday. Where I work, if we’re hosting an event or party we will set up the tables nicely but require people to bring their own decorations etc ready to be placed on the table. I was the unfortunate soul serving this table and while I’m busy making about 20 milkshakes the mother comes to me with big ass balloons and tells me to blow them up and take them out with the milkshakes. Not my job lady and I’m busy. Between me and the other servers we manage to get all her decorations sorted and taken out with the milkshakes. Catered to these childrens every request and got tipped less than 5%. And she didn’t even get charged the small fee we usually charge to host parties. \n\nLastly, people changing their minds last minute drives me up the wall. Yesterday a woman ordered a cappuccino with cream. I checked twice that she wanted cream instead of foam and she was adamant that she did. Make the coffee and take it to her when she says no she wanted foam. Took it back and just scooped the cream out with a spoon and filled it with foam. Should I have made her a new one? Yes. Did I feel like doing it in the middle of the lunch rush? No. Another customer had ordered a waffle with a caramel sauce, take it to her and she knocks it over and requests another one. Go back to the kitchen which was already chaotic because again, lunch time rush, request a fresh sauce, take it out to her and she says “oh never mind, I don’t need the sauce anymore. Something else that just has to go in the bin. \n\nPeople make me f*cking insane",

I go over and explain to him that it’s a 18% tip we charge for having such a large party, and I’m sorry if no one brought this up while making the reservation. He asked if I can split the bill with multiple people, I tell him that’s not a problem, and he asks if the gratuity is going to be on the “new checks” which I reply yes, you’re still the same party just paying with multiple cards and he replies to me “that’s a 60% tip?!” I’m now standing there dumbfounded and no way am I going to try to explain to this man how percentages work.

    "text_content": "So here's a question from the other side. I'm actually a pretty good tipper. But I don't dress fancy and I like my comfortable jeans and comfy shirts. I don't look like much and sometimes I'm convinced that servers are writing me off as a potential tip and as a consequence I get fair to neglectful service most of the time. If it's not outright horrible, I still leave 15% to 20%, but I usually tip even more than that for decent service. (Yes, I used to be a server and I know this is a hard job)\n\nPlaces I go regularly have now caught on and I get excellent service all the time, and I leave great tips there. But when I go to a new place, I often feel like they assume the worst, treat me badly, sometimes to the point that I feel badly about leaving a generous tip in vague hopes that I will get better service in the future.\n\nSo, what to do. I never got a tip BEFORE serving a table when I was working, but maybe that's a way to let people know I'm going to give a decent tip, so it's worth their effort to try to do a good job. Are there any other ways besides sticking to places that know me, to better signal that even as a dumpy looking nothing special guy I'm going to reward decent service well, and excellent service spectacularly?\n\nOkay here's an example. I met a friend for lunch and we were kind of leisurely about the whole thing. Catching up and talking for a while after we finished the meal. Service was fine, nothing special, but as we're chatting afterwards no one made any move to hurry us along or try to get us out of this table. In my opinion, this is great service and I left a great tip (more than 50%). But I can also see that it could have gone differently and more often than not it does, which I attribute to servers not thinking there's likely to be a good tip from the scruffy guy. This lunch worked great, but what can I do to increase my odds of good service. I'm willing to tip appropriately in appreciation of good service. How do I let servers know this in advance without sounding like \"I'll take care of you\" guy, who likely stiffs them in the end.\n",

I check back in about 5mins later, and she hasn’t touched it.\n\nMe: “Is there something wrong with this one too?”\n\nThis is what she says verbatim:\n\nHer: “This is all guts and gizzards.

In front of my guests, now I know it sounds like I'm bashing servers, I'm not, I serve too. I'm bashing people inconsiderate of their co-workers. \n\nSecond issue, frozen drink machine is already broke down and clean. She wants a daiquiri. No biggie, put it back together and make her a drink. \n\nThird issue, bread is more like croutons. I go ahead and give it to them, go to the back, and there is no one to make bread, so I go scoop up a tray and put it in the oven, run back and tell the table that I've got some fresh coming. That since the baker was gone, I'm cooking it myself. \n\nSalads come out good, apps in record time, and all is well they are having a good time and I'm slowly falling further and further behind. \n\nCome time to get the bill, I realized I forgot to ring up the salads, fuck it.

Turn around and evidently he was just in the bathroom, heard everything. \n\nI'm pretty sure I'm fired come Monday. I train the new servers, that to not let any one tip upset them. I just let all the things build up, I can't take it anymore. I'm screwed.\n\nI'm at the bar, buddy is doing a successful job at getting me drunk. I hate life.\n\nTl;dr I cussed a customer after they were shits, turns out he was just in the bathroom. In my defense, it was almost an hour after close.",
